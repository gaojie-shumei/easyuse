22,31262,"Objective: To observe the pattern of injuries in patients involved in different kinds of trauma presenting to the Accident and Emergency Department of Jinnah Hospital Lahore. Design: A prospective descriptive epidemiological study. Place and duration of study: Accident and emergency department of Jinnah Hospital Lahore. From 1st April 2005 to 30th September 2005. Subjects and methods: The study included patients presenting with different kinds of trauma to the emergency department of Jinnah Hospital, Lahore. They were further categorized into trauma of different regions of the body i.e. upper limb, lower limb, abdomen, head & neck, thorax and perineum. Then frequency of different types of trauma was determined. Results: During this period (1st April2005 to 30th September 2005), 111`413 patients presented in accident and emergency department and 4680 patients had traumatic injury. 1404 patients (30%) had blunt trauma, 134(2.86%) had penetrating firearms injury, 2433(51.99%) had penetrating sharp injury an d 709 patients (15.15%) had crush injury. Most patients got upper limb, lower limb, head & neck and abdominal injuries, in that order. Most patients received multiple injuries. 3340 patients (71.36%) got only minor surgery like stitching under local anaesthesia and 468 patients (10%) had no surgery at all. 872 patients (18.63%) underwent some kind of major surgical procedure like amputation, exploratory laparotomy, or stitching under GA etc. Conclusion: Trauma is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among all age groups. Most of the trauma victims receiving minor injuries can be treated at primary heath care centers. This can decrease the load of tertiary care hospitals. Maximum impact in reducing the burden of trauma must come from injury prevention strategies.",1

56,31296,"As the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (“ICIJ”) selectively made public leaked documents relating to more than 200,000 offshore entities held by clients of Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca, it emerged that nearly a third of these clients were found to be in Hong Kong and the PRC.",1
57,31297,"The revelation should not be a big surprise as at least a third of direct investment into Hong Kong comes from companies principally based in the British Virgin Islands and Bermuda. There are many reasons to use such offshore booking centres – both legitimate and illegitimate – with some entities clearly using them to evade domestic capital controls in China, and others in Hong Kong benefiting from capturing funds within local stock and property markets.",1
58,31298,"Nevertheless the media spotlight on Hong Kong as a hub for offshore services was not a positive one. What it means in the grand scheme of things is unclear. Anecdotally, fund managers are suggesting the recent stock market slump reflects a general unease in using offshore entities for large investments. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority meanwhile has requested banks to appraise their clients’ exposure to the Mossack Fonseca leaks.",1
59,31299,"In its bid to convince the rest of the world that Hong Kong’s role in the Panama Papers is nothing more than guilt by association, regulatory pressure will likely fall on some of Hong Kong’s weak spots, with money laundering and its ongoing requirement to meet global standards an obvious target.",1
60,31300,"Money flows through Hong Kong are increasingly on policy-makers’ radar. As capital poured into China’s booming economy for most of the last 15 years, its monetary authorities could afford to take a lax approach. The situation has now shifted as China faces capital outflow and the senior leadership is acutely focused on anti-corruption efforts. At the same time, China wants to establish the renminbi as an international currency, epitomised by the International Monetary Fund’s recent decision to include the unit in its “special drawing rights” basket. And in this regard, Hong Kong’s status as an alleged money laundering centre does matter.",1
61,31301,"As a result, the Hong Kong government is acutely sensitive to the issues raised by the Panama Papers. Chan Ka-keung, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, recently defended Hong Kong’s “anti-money laundering’’ credentials within the Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”). Chan noted that politicians and commentators in many developed economies are quick to label countries with low tax rates and more liberal policies as money laundering havens. “This is very wrong’’ he said.",1
62,31302,"One problem is that Hong Kong is the only FATF member with no system of currency declaration or disclosure at its border. After a 2008 evaluation by FATF inspectors revealed shortcomings in its reporting mechanisms, officials agreed to provide biannual updates on its anti-money laundering and terrorist financing efforts. A progress report was given in 2012, but subsequently deadlines have been allowed to slip. Inspectors were due to make a follow up visit in April 2016 according to a disclosure by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, but that has now been bounced to as far back as July 2018 according to the official FATF calendar with a plenary session to discuss findings slated in February 2019.",1
63,31303,"Such a delay will likely be welcomed by the SAR government as Hong Kong’s report card has some hits, but a fair few misses since the FATF’s last assessment in 2012. In the plus corner, both the number and variety of court convictions have risen and financial institutions can point to solid results from giving staff more awareness training; 42,555 suspicious transaction reports were made in 2015 compared to 37,188 in 2014. The momentum has been mainlined this year with 13,297 reports made in the first quarter (seeJoint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1
64,31304,"The number of convictions for money laundering, however, is on a mildly declining trend with 27 in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 122 in 2015, 145 in 2014, 138 in 2013 and 160 in 2012. The value of assets “restrained”, or interceded but not ceased, varies greatly depending on the complexity of the prosecution: in the first quarter of 2016 the figure was a fairly insignificant HK$73.5 million compared to HK$341.5 million in 2015, HK$418.9 million in 2014 and HK$873.4 million in 2013 (seeJoint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1
65,31305,"Moreover, actually seizing assets on behalf of the government has proven difficult. The authorities had a big win in 2013 when HK$645 million was secured, but this masks a generally weak performance. In the first quarter of 2016 just HK$1.3 million was secured versus HK$55 million in 2015 and HK$23.6 million in 2012 (seeJoint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1
66,31306,"At the same time the regulatory focus has widened in recent years. With enactment of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance (Cap. 615) (the “AMLO”) in 2012, law enforcers are increasingly targeting frontline gate-keepers.",1
67,31307,"Shortcomings in customer due diligence have resulted in a number of prosecutions over the past 18 months, with the rate gathering pace. The majority appear to have been money service operators rather than high-profile banks, and the tenor of the charges suggest an initial “low hanging fruit” line of attack.",1
68,31308,"In April 2016, for example, a money service operator was convicted at the Eastern Magistrates’ Court for breaching the licensing requirements of the AMLO, resulting in a fine of HK$4,000. In June 2015, a money service operator was sentenced to 200 hours of community service at Fanling Magistrates’ Court after pleading guilty to 12 charges of failing to comply with the customer due diligence and record-keeping. Other prosecutions have resulted in fines, public reprimands and appeared to result from compliance inspections conducted by Customs & Excise officers.",1
69,31309,"Despite these gains, high-profile legal setbacks may derail Hong Kong’s FATF report card. At the time of going to press, Carson Yeung’s final appeal has been heard at the top court (May 31 to 2 June 2016).",1219
70,31310,"Yeung was granted leave to appeal (HKSAR (applicant) v Yeung Ka Sing, Carson (Respondent), FAMC 28&29 of 2015) in August last year. The fact that Yeung was granted bail pending the outcome has prompted optimism among critics of Hong Kong’s “draconian” money laundering laws that a robust overhaul would ensue.",3
71,31311,"Yeung was convicted of five charges of dealing with property known or believed to represent the proceeds of an indictable offence, by using five bank accounts to launder HK$721 million between 2 January 2001 and 31 December 2007, contrary to s. 25(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) (“OSCO”).",3
72,31312,"One of the issues to be dealt with was whether the prosecution must prove that the proceeds (the “property’’) being dealt with in a money laundering charge derives from a criminal act. Heavy criticism has been meted out for the approach taken in Hong Kong. In the UK, the prosecution must prove a predicate offence.",1
73,31313,"One of the questions posed in Yeung’s appeal is whether Oei Hengky Wiryo v SAR (No. 2) (2007) 10 HKCFAR 98 was wrongly decided on this issue. The mens rea for the offence was also under scrutiny and the operation of the rule against duplicity was also to be considered. If it is felt by the CFA that this is not a safe conviction, it remains to be seen in what kind of shape the ordinance emerges. Should prosecutors have to prove a predicate offence, the bar for a conviction would be set significantly higher.",3
74,31314,"In theory, one area of progress Hong Kong should be able to report to the FATF is a system for cross-border currency disclosure, after it was labelled as non-compliant back in 2012 due to an inadequate system for disclosing and declaring cross border transactions.",1
75,31315,"FATF did credit Hong for its April 2012 initiative to adopt a mixed system of declarations for inbound passengers and disclosure for outbound ones, setting the threshold for reporting at HK$120,000. The global watchdog lauded this “fast-track” approach as it expected the legislation to be presented “within 2014.” However, it was not until 2015 that a public consultation was carried out.",1
76,31316,"Given the challenges posed by Hong Kong’s polarised legislature, the fact that lawmakers baulked at the very idea of a declaration system does not bode well for legislation passing any time soon. Already tourism industry figures have spurned the plans as mainland visitors tend to shop using large sums of cash. Lawmaker Christopher Chung Shu-kun commented last year that HK$120,000 “is not even enough to buy a watch.”",1
77,31317,"The latest update came in February 2016 when it was stated that the Security Bureau would collate feedback with a view to implementing the system, although no time frame was given. The impression was given of the issue being left in the long grass.",1
78,31318,"Arguably, it would be easier to focus on Hong Kong’s deep bench of legal and accounting professionals. Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professionals (“DNFBPs”) featured prominently in the 2012 report and in particular the disparity between sanctions the various professions face.",1
79,31319,"It was noted that DNFBPs were reticent to submit reports. There has been progress on this front – while in 2007 there were just nine suspicious transaction reports (“STRs”) by lawyers, three from accountants and five from trust and company service providers (“TCSPs”), in 2015 the legal sector provided 894. The increase for accountants and TCSPs was less impressive, with the professions providing six and 22 STRs respectively in 2015 (for the 2007 figures, see FATF Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong, China, 19 Oct 2012, p. 33; for the 2015 & 2016 figures, see Joint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1
80,31320,"Perhaps the most pressing question is what will be the catalyst to shift Hong Kong’s somewhat anomalous approach to cross-border financial reporting. The betting must be that Beijing will increasingly want to regulate such monetary flows both from the perspective of macro-prudential financial stability and anti-corruption initiatives. As the country seeks to become a top-tier financial player it will be pulled toward the adoption of international norms, and so pressure will fall on Hong Kong to become truly FATF compliant.",1

173,28928,"As the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (“ICIJ”) selectively made public leaked documents relating to more than 200,000 offshore entities held by clients of Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca, it emerged that nearly a third of these clients were found to be in Hong Kong and the PRC.",1
174,28929,"The revelation should not be a big surprise as at least a third of direct investment into Hong Kong comes from companies principally based in the British Virgin Islands and Bermuda. There are many reasons to use such offshore booking centres – both legitimate and illegitimate – with some entities clearly using them to evade domestic capital controls in China, and others in Hong Kong benefiting from capturing funds within local stock and property markets.",1
175,28930,"Nevertheless the media spotlight on Hong Kong as a hub for offshore services was not a positive one. What it means in the grand scheme of things is unclear. Anecdotally, fund managers are suggesting the recent stock market slump reflects a general unease in using offshore entities for large investments. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority meanwhile has requested banks to appraise their clients’ exposure to the Mossack Fonseca leaks.",2
176,28931,"In its bid to convince the rest of the world that Hong Kong’s role in the Panama Papers is nothing more than guilt by association, regulatory pressure will likely fall on some of Hong Kong’s weak spots, with money laundering and its ongoing requirement to meet global standards an obvious target.",1
177,28932,"Money flows through Hong Kong are increasingly on policy-makers’ radar. As capital poured into China’s booming economy for most of the last 15 years, its monetary authorities could afford to take a lax approach. The situation has now shifted as China faces capital outflow and the senior leadership is acutely focused on anti-corruption efforts. At the same time, China wants to establish the renminbi as an international currency, epitomised by the International Monetary Fund’s recent decision to include the unit in its “special drawing rights” basket. And in this regard, Hong Kong’s status as an alleged money laundering centre does matter.",1
178,28933,"As a result, the Hong Kong government is acutely sensitive to the issues raised by the Panama Papers. Chan Ka-keung, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, recently defended Hong Kong’s “anti-money laundering’’ credentials within the Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”). Chan noted that politicians and commentators in many developed economies are quick to label countries with low tax rates and more liberal policies as money laundering havens. “This is very wrong’’ he said.",1
179,28934,"One problem is that Hong Kong is the only FATF member with no system of currency declaration or disclosure at its border. After a 2008 evaluation by FATF inspectors revealed shortcomings in its reporting mechanisms, officials agreed to provide biannual updates on its anti-money laundering and terrorist financing efforts. A progress report was given in 2012, but subsequently deadlines have been allowed to slip. Inspectors were due to make a follow up visit in April 2016 according to a disclosure by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, but that has now been bounced to as far back as July 2018 according to the official FATF calendar with a plenary session to discuss findings slated in February 2019.",2
180,28935,"Such a delay will likely be welcomed by the SAR government as Hong Kong’s report card has some hits, but a fair few misses since the FATF’s last assessment in 2012. In the plus corner, both the number and variety of court convictions have risen and financial institutions can point to solid results from giving staff more awareness training; 42,555 suspicious transaction reports were made in 2015 compared to 37,188 in 2014. The momentum has been mainlined this year with 13,297 reports made in the first quarter (seeJoint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1
181,28936,"The number of convictions for money laundering, however, is on a mildly declining trend with 27 in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 122 in 2015, 145 in 2014, 138 in 2013 and 160 in 2012. The value of assets “restrained”, or interceded but not ceased, varies greatly depending on the complexity of the prosecution: in the first quarter of 2016 the figure was a fairly insignificant HK$73.5 million compared to HK$341.5 million in 2015, HK$418.9 million in 2014 and HK$873.4 million in 2013 (seeJoint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1
182,28937,"Moreover, actually seizing assets on behalf of the government has proven difficult. The authorities had a big win in 2013 when HK$645 million was secured, but this masks a generally weak performance. In the first quarter of 2016 just HK$1.3 million was secured versus HK$55 million in 2015 and HK$23.6 million in 2012 (seeJoint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1
183,28938,"At the same time the regulatory focus has widened in recent years. With enactment of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance (Cap. 615) (the “AMLO”) in 2012, law enforcers are increasingly targeting frontline gate-keepers.",1
184,28939,"Shortcomings in customer due diligence have resulted in a number of prosecutions over the past 18 months, with the rate gathering pace.

185,28940,"In April 2016, for example, a money service operator was convicted at the Eastern Magistrates’ Court for breaching the licensing requirements of the AMLO, resulting in a fine of HK$4,000. In June 2015, a money service operator was sentenced to 200 hours of community service at Fanling Magistrates’ Court after pleading guilty to 12 charges of failing to comply with the customer due diligence and record-keeping. Other prosecutions have resulted in fines, public reprimands and appeared to result from compliance inspections conducted by Customs & Excise officers.",1
186,28941,"Despite these gains, high-profile legal setbacks may derail Hong Kong’s FATF report card. At the time of going to press, Carson Yeung’s final appeal has been heard at the top court (May 31 to 2 June 2016).",2
187,28942,"Yeung was granted leave to appeal (HKSAR (applicant) v Yeung Ka Sing, Carson (Respondent), FAMC 28&29 of 2015) in August last year. The fact that Yeung was granted bail pending the outcome has prompted optimism among critics of Hong Kong’s “draconian” money laundering laws that a robust overhaul would ensue.",3
188,28943,"Yeung was convicted of five charges of dealing with property known or believed to represent the proceeds of an indictable offence, by using five bank accounts to launder HK$721 million between 2 January 2001 and 31 December 2007, contrary to s. 25(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) (“OSCO”).",3
189,28944,"One of the issues to be dealt with was whether the prosecution must prove that the proceeds (the “property’’) being dealt with in a money laundering charge derives from a criminal act. Heavy criticism has been meted out for the approach taken in Hong Kong. In the UK, the prosecution must prove a predicate offence.",2
190,28945,"One of the questions posed in Yeung’s appeal is whether Oei Hengky Wiryo v SAR (No. 2) (2007) 10 HKCFAR 98 was wrongly decided on this issue. The mens rea for the offence was also under scrutiny and the operation of the rule against duplicity was also to be considered. If it is felt by the CFA that this is not a safe conviction, it remains to be seen in what kind of shape the ordinance emerges. Should prosecutors have to prove a predicate offence, the bar for a conviction would be set significantly higher.",2
191,28946,"In theory, one area of progress Hong Kong should be able to report to the FATF is a system for cross-border currency disclosure, after it was labelled as non-compliant back in 2012 due to an inadequate system for disclosing and declaring cross border transactions.",1
192,28947,"FATF did credit Hong for its April 2012 initiative to adopt a mixed system of declarations for inbound passengers and disclosure for outbound ones, setting the threshold for reporting at HK$120,000. The global watchdog lauded this “fast-track” approach as it expected the legislation to be presented “within 2014.” However, it was not until 2015 that a public consultation was carried out.",1
193,28948,"Given the challenges posed by Hong Kong’s polarised legislature, the fact that lawmakers baulked at the very idea of a declaration system does not bode well for legislation passing any time soon. Already tourism industry figures have spurned the plans as mainland visitors tend to shop using large sums of cash. Lawmaker Christopher Chung Shu-kun commented last year that HK$120,000 “is not even enough to buy a watch.”",1
194,28949,"The latest update came in February 2016 when it was stated that the Security Bureau would collate feedback with a view to implementing the system, although no time frame was given. The impression was given of the issue being left in the long grass.",1
195,28950,"Arguably, it would be easier to focus on Hong Kong’s deep bench of legal and accounting professionals. Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professionals (“DNFBPs”) featured prominently in the 2012 report and in particular the disparity between sanctions the various professions face.",1
196,28951,"It was noted that DNFBPs were reticent to submit reports.

383,31514,What is Robot?,1
384,31515, Definition 1:,1
385,31516,a robot is a software-controllable mechanical,1
386,31517,device that uses sensors to guide one or more end-,1
387,31518,effectors through programmed motions in a,1
388,31519,workspace in order to manipulate physical objects.,1
389,31520,OR,1
390,31521, Definition 2:,1
391,31522,Specialized devices through various programmed,1
392,31523,motions for the performance of a variety of tasks,1
393,31524,3.,1
394,31525,The Characteristics of Robot,1
395,31526,There are four essential characteristics of Robot,1
396,31527, Sensing,1
397,31528,First of all your robot would have to be able to sense its,1
398,31529,surroundings. It would do this in ways that are similar,1
399,31530,to the way that you sense your surroundings. Giving,1
400,31531,"your robot sensors: light sensors (eyes), touch and",1
401,31532,"pressure sensors (hands), chemical",1
402,31533,"sensors (nose), hearing and sonar sensors (ears), and",1
403,31534,taste sensors (tongue) will give your robot awareness,1
404,31535,of its environment.,1
405,31536,Robotics,1
406,31537,4.,1
407,31538,The Characteristics of Robot,1
408,31539, Movement,1
409,31540,A robot needs to be able to move,1
410,31541,around its environment. Whether,1
411,31542,"rolling on wheels, walking on legs",1
412,31543,or propelling by thrusters a robot,1
413,31544,needs to be able to move. To count,1
414,31545,as a robot either the whole robot,1
415,31546,moves or just parts of the robot,1
416,31547,moves,1
417,31548,Robotics,1
418,31549,5.,1
419,31550,The Characteristics of Robot,1
420,31551, Energy,1
421,31552,A robot needs to be able to power itself. A robot might be,1
422,31553,"solar powered, electrically powered, battery powered. The",1
423,31554,way your robot gets its energy will depend on what your,1
424,31555,robot needs to do.,1
425,31556, Intelligence,1
426,31557,"A robot needs some kind of ""smarts."" This is where",1
427,31558,programming enters the pictures. A programmer is the,1
428,31559,person who gives the robot its 'smarts.' The robot will have,1
429,31560,to have some way to receive the program so that it knows,1
430,31561,what it is to do.,1
431,31562,Robotics,1

433,31564,Laws of Robot,1
434,31565, Law One:,1
435,31566,A robot may not injure a human being or through,1
436,31567,inaction allow a human being to come to harm.,1
437,31568, Law Two:,1
438,31569,A robot must obey the orders given it by human,1
439,31570,"beings, except where such orders would conflict with",1
440,31571,the First Law.,1
441,31572, Law Three:,1
442,31573,"A robot must protect its own existence, as long as such",1
443,31574,protection does not conflict with the First or Second,1
444,31575,Laws.,1
445,31576,Robotics,1
446,31577,7.,1
447,31578,First Robot of the World,1
448,31579, These were the first robots. The,1
449,31580,robot's name was Elektro and his,1
450,31581,dog's name was Sparko. They,1
451,31582,appeared at the New York World's,1
452,31583,"Fair in 1939. While plugged in,",1
453,31584,Elektro could say 77 words and,1
454,31585,move backwards and forwards.,1

457,31588,Robotics,1
458,31589,Types of Robot (w.r.t) moment,1
459,31590,Mainly there are two types of robot,1
460,31591, Fixed Robot or Manipulator,1
461,31592,The robots which are fixed on a,1
462,31593,specific point and moving around,1
463,31594,that point is called fixed Robot or,1
464,31595,manipulators. Mostly these types,1
465,31596,of Robot use in industries,1
466,31597,9.,1
467,31598,Robotics,1
468,31599,Types of Robot (w.r.t) moment,1
469,31600, Mobile Robot,1
470,31601,The robots which are freely,1
471,31602,move from one location to,1
472,31603,another location are called,1
473,31604,Mobile Robots. Mostly such a,1
474,31605,types of Robots are used for,1
475,31606,houses working like gross,1
476,31607,cutting and washroom cleaning,1
477,31608,10.,1
478,31609,Classification Of Robots,1
479,31610, Industrial Robots:,1
480,31611,A type of robots capable of performing industrial,1
481,31612,"production processes. Such processes includes: welding,",1
482,31613,"assembly, machine loading and unloading, painting and",1
483,31614,sheep shearing etc.,1
484,31615, Personal Robots:,1
485,31616,General-purpose rather than highly specialized,1
486,31617,industrial robots. Much more humanoid in shape and,1
487,31618,ability than most industrial robots.,1
488,31619, Military Robots:,1
489,31620,Also known as autonomous vehicles. An example is a,1
490,31621,cruise missile. They have sensing capacities designed to,1
491,31622,interpret their environment.,1

493,31624,12.,1
494,31625,Robotics,1
495,31626,Comparison of Robot with Human being,1
496,31627, Machines do not breath:,1
497,31628,Robots have no breath so it is suitable for,1
498,31629,work in such a environment where need of,1
499,31630,"oxygen like work in different planets, work",1
500,31631,"in seabed exploration, for human being",1
501,31632,these tasks are difficult.,1
502,31633, Machines (Robots) works in poisonous,1
503,31634,materials:,1
504,31635,Whenever human being work with,1
505,31636,"poisonous material, faced with different",1
506,31637,"types of disease, for example work in",1
507,31638,"chemical laboratories, so it is danger for",1
508,31639,"human health, another example is working",1
509,31640,"with uranium in nuclear reactors, it is very",1
510,31641,"harmful. For such a types of activities,",1
511,31642,robots are best choice.,1
512,31643,13.,1
513,31644, Machines (Robots) are stronger then Human:,1
514,31645,Robots are stronger then human being it gives high performance because,1
515,31646,Robots can work for 24 hours while human can get tired. Human can bored,1
516,31647,from repetitive work. If there is strictness it effect the performance of human,1
517,31648,while Robot can works in any type of environment,1
518,31649, Robots are precise while human not,1
519,31650,human being are not consistent in his work because hum can have a lot of,1
520,31651,"problems for examples problems related to his body, family problems,",1
521,31652,"environment problems, so these problem can effect human activities while",1
522,31653,Robots are free from such problems and can perform his jobs precisely and,1
523,31654,smoothly,1
524,31655, Availability of Robot and Human,1
525,31656,Human being not available all the time but Machine (Robot) is available any,1
526,31657,"time because there is no breaks, no off days and no leave",1
527,31658,Robotics,1
528,31659,16.,1
529,31660,Robotics,1
530,31661,What are the uses of Robot,1
531,31662, Vehicle and car factories,1
532,31663,mostly the robots are use in vehicles factories for moving,1
533,31664,heavy parts like engine from one location another location.,1
534,31665,"It is also for assembling different parts of vehicles, spring,",1
535,31666,painting vehicle precisely and welding of different parts,1
536,31667,etc. Robots increase the productivity.,1
537,31668, Highways,1
538,31669,the highways are the most important source of,1
539,31670,communication. Developed countries expend a lot of,1
540,31671,money on highways. So robots play very important role,1
541,31672,"regarding highways, like road level, pressing road surface",1
542,31673,and tunnels,1
543,31674,19.,1
544,31675,Robotics,1
545,31676, Food companies,1
546,31677,the robots are used in food companies like products,1
547,31678,"assembling, products packing, products sealing and",1
548,31679,products shifting from one location to another. For,1
549,31680,"example robots are used in Lays company, Nestle etc.",1
550,31681,most tasks performed by the robots,1
551,31682,21.,1
552,31683,Robotics,1
553,31684, Danger Places,1
554,31685,The robots are best candidates where from human,1

570,31701,"Among other seizures by the NIA officials were also the water pipes. “They have given us receipt of the seizures that they made – such as inverter circuits, batteries, water pipes and mobile phones of the entire family members – after we requested them for the same. Even they have given us in writing that they found nothing suspicious in my house,” said Ahmad.",1
571,31702,"When asked how the raid was conducted, Ahmad said they (the NIA officers) entered his house at around 4-4.30 am, and virtually ransacked the house during the search. “They did not show us any court order or warrant. We were also not informed about the reason behind the raid. We could not dare to ask and interrupt, as they had weapons,” he said.",1
572,31703,"Asked about his son, Ahmad said that Sohail shifted to Amroha from Jaffrabad two months ago. “He was teaching Quran in a local madrasa. He was doing the same here as well. He shifted to Amroha because our entire family is there, including my brothers,” he said.",1

574,31705,"“Azam’s wife and his five-year-old daughter were sleeping when the officers reached his home. They began searching the house. The mother-daughter duo woke up because of the sudden commotion. They were scared and started crying. She (Azam’s wife) called me, and we went there. After searching Azam’s house, they went to his medical shop, and searched that as well. They seized some Urdu books lying there. They took Azam into custody, and left with his and his wife’s mobile phones,” he told Newsclick.",1
575,31706,"His father told Newsclick that Azam quit studies after class 12 to open a garment shop, which he shut down four years ago, and opened a medical shop. He got married five years back. “He used to spend majority of the time at home with his family once the shop was closed. He is not much talkative, and had no other engagement. It is being alleged that he was associated with ISIS, but if you ask him to pronounce it (the abbreviation), he won’t be able to do it,” said the father.",1
576,31707,"Asked about his relations with others who have been arrested, Basheer said, “Azam only knows Sohail, as we live close by, and Azam runs a medical shop. Azam had spoken to him over the phone a few times.”",1

583,31714,"The Panama Papers showed Hong Kong to be a controlling node in the global network of offshore financial centres which allows individuals and companies to manage legitimate trade-flows and tax optimisation strategies, but also to squirrel away ill-gotten gains.",1
584,31715,"As the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (“ICIJ”) selectively made public leaked documents relating to more than 200,000 offshore entities held by clients of Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca, it emerged that nearly a third of these clients were found to be in Hong Kong and the PRC.",1
585,31716,"The revelation should not be a big surprise as at least a third of direct investment into Hong Kong comes from companies principally based in the British Virgin Islands and Bermuda. There are many reasons to use such offshore booking centres – both legitimate and illegitimate – with some entities clearly using them to evade domestic capital controls in China, and others in Hong Kong benefiting from capturing funds within local stock and property markets.",1
586,31717,"Nevertheless the media spotlight on Hong Kong as a hub for offshore services was not a positive one. What it means in the grand scheme of things is unclear. Anecdotally, fund managers are suggesting the recent stock market slump reflects a general unease in using offshore entities for large investments. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority meanwhile has requested banks to appraise their clients’ exposure to the Mossack Fonseca leaks.",2
587,31718,"In its bid to convince the rest of the world that Hong Kong’s role in the Panama Papers is nothing more than guilt by association, regulatory pressure will likely fall on some of Hong Kong’s weak spots, with money laundering and its ongoing requirement to meet global standards an obvious target.",2
588,31719,"Money flows through Hong Kong are increasingly on policy-makers’ radar. As capital poured into China’s booming economy for most of the last 15 years, its monetary authorities could afford to take a lax approach. The situation has now shifted as China faces capital outflow and the senior leadership is acutely focused on anti-corruption efforts. At the same time, China wants to establish the renminbi as an international currency, epitomised by the International Monetary Fund’s recent decision to include the unit in its “special drawing rights” basket. And in this regard, Hong Kong’s status as an alleged money laundering centre does matter.",2
589,31720,"As a result, the Hong Kong government is acutely sensitive to the issues raised by the Panama Papers. Chan Ka-keung, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, recently defended Hong Kong’s “anti-money laundering’’ credentials within the Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”). Chan noted that politicians and commentators in many developed economies are quick to label countries with low tax rates and more liberal policies as money laundering havens. “This is very wrong’’ he said.",1
590,31721,"One problem is that Hong Kong is the only FATF member with no system of currency declaration or disclosure at its border. After a 2008 evaluation by FATF inspectors revealed shortcomings in its reporting mechanisms, officials agreed to provide biannual updates on its anti-money laundering and terrorist financing efforts. A progress report was given in 2012, but subsequently deadlines have been allowed to slip. Inspectors were due to make a follow up visit in April 2016 according to a disclosure by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, but that has now been bounced to as far back as July 2018 according to the official FATF calendar with a plenary session to discuss findings slated in February 2019.",2
591,31722,"Such a delay will likely be welcomed by the SAR government as Hong Kong’s report card has some hits, but a fair few misses since the FATF’s last assessment in 2012. In the plus corner, both the number and variety of court convictions have risen and financial institutions can point to solid results from giving staff more awareness training; 42,555 suspicious transaction reports were made in 2015 compared to 37,188 in 2014. The momentum has been mainlined this year with 13,297 reports made in the first quarter (seeJoint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1
592,31723,"The number of convictions for money laundering, however, is on a mildly declining trend with 27 in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 122 in 2015, 145 in 2014, 138 in 2013 and 160 in 2012. The value of assets “restrained”, or interceded but not ceased, varies greatly depending on the complexity of the prosecution: in the first quarter of 2016 the figure was a fairly insignificant HK$73.5 million compared to HK$341.5 million in 2015, HK$418.9 million in 2014 and HK$873.4 million in 2013 (seeJoint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",2
593,31724,"Moreover, actually seizing assets on behalf of the government has proven difficult. The authorities had a big win in 2013 when HK$645 million was secured, but this masks a generally weak performance. In the first quarter of 2016 just HK$1.3 million was secured versus HK$55 million in 2015 and HK$23.6 million in 2012 (seeJoint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1
594,31725,"At the same time the regulatory focus has widened in recent years. With enactment of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance (Cap. 615) (the “AMLO”) in 2012, law enforcers are increasingly targeting frontline gate-keepers.",1
595,31726,"Shortcomings in customer due diligence have resulted in a number of prosecutions over the past 18 months, with the rate gathering pace. The majority appear to have been money service operators rather than high-profile banks, and the tenor of the charges suggest an initial “low hanging fruit” line of attack.",1
596,31727,"In April 2016, for example, a money service operator was convicted at the Eastern Magistrates’ Court for breaching the licensing requirements of the AMLO, resulting in a fine of HK$4,000. In June 2015, a money service operator was sentenced to 200 hours of community service at Fanling Magistrates’ Court after pleading guilty to 12 charges of failing to comply with the customer due diligence and record-keeping. Other prosecutions have resulted in fines, public reprimands and appeared to result from compliance inspections conducted by Customs & Excise officers.",2
597,31728,"Despite these gains, high-profile legal setbacks may derail Hong Kong’s FATF report card. At the time of going to press, Carson Yeung’s final appeal has been heard at the top court (May 31 to 2 June 2016).",1
598,31729,"Yeung was granted leave to appeal (HKSAR (applicant) v Yeung Ka Sing, Carson (Respondent), FAMC 28&29 of 2015) in August last year. The fact that Yeung was granted bail pending the outcome has prompted optimism among critics of Hong Kong’s “draconian” money laundering laws that a robust overhaul would ensue.",3
599,31730,"Yeung was convicted of five charges of dealing with property known or believed to represent the proceeds of an indictable offence, by using five bank accounts to launder HK$721 million between 2 January 2001 and 31 December 2007, contrary to s. 25(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) (“OSCO”).",3
600,31731,"One of the issues to be dealt with was whether the prosecution must prove that the proceeds (the “property’’) being dealt with in a money laundering charge derives from a criminal act. Heavy criticism has been meted out for the approach taken in Hong Kong. In the UK, the prosecution must prove a predicate offence.",1
601,31732,"One of the questions posed in Yeung’s appeal is whether Oei Hengky Wiryo v SAR (No. 2) (2007) 10 HKCFAR 98 was wrongly decided on this issue. The mens rea for the offence was also under scrutiny and the operation of the rule against duplicity was also to be considered. If it is felt by the CFA that this is not a safe conviction, it remains to be seen in what kind of shape the ordinance emerges. Should prosecutors have to prove a predicate offence, the bar for a conviction would be set significantly higher.",2
602,31733,"In theory, one area of progress Hong Kong should be able to report to the FATF is a system for cross-border currency disclosure, after it was labelled as non-compliant back in 2012 due to an inadequate system for disclosing and declaring cross border transactions.",1
603,31734,"FATF did credit Hong for its April 2012 initiative to adopt a mixed system of declarations for inbound passengers and disclosure for outbound ones, setting the threshold for reporting at HK$120,000. The global watchdog lauded this “fast-track” approach as it expected the legislation to be presented “within 2014.” However, it was not until 2015 that a public consultation was carried out.",1
604,31735,"Given the challenges posed by Hong Kong’s polarised legislature, the fact that lawmakers baulked at the very idea of a declaration system does not bode well for legislation passing any time soon. Already tourism industry figures have spurned the plans as mainland visitors tend to shop using large sums of cash. Lawmaker Christopher Chung Shu-kun commented last year that HK$120,000 “is not even enough to buy a watch.”",2
605,31736,"The latest update came in February 2016 when it was stated that the Security Bureau would collate feedback with a view to implementing the system, although no time frame was given. The impression was given of the issue being left in the long grass.",1
606,31737,"Arguably, it would be easier to focus on Hong Kong’s deep bench of legal and accounting professionals. Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professionals (“DNFBPs”) featured prominently in the 2012 report and in particular the disparity between sanctions the various professions face.",1
607,31738,"It was noted that DNFBPs were reticent to submit reports. There has been progress on this front – while in 2007 there were just nine suspicious transaction reports (“STRs”) by lawyers, three from accountants and five from trust and company service providers (“TCSPs”), in 2015 the legal sector provided 894. The increase for accountants and TCSPs was less impressive, with the professions providing six and 22 STRs respectively in 2015 (for the 2007 figures, see FATF Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong, China, 19 Oct 2012, p. 33; for the 2015 & 2016 figures, see Joint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",2
608,31739,"Perhaps the most pressing question is what will be the catalyst to shift Hong Kong’s somewhat anomalous approach to cross-border financial reporting. The betting must be that Beijing will increasingly want to regulate such monetary flows both from the perspective of macro-prudential financial stability and anti-corruption initiatives. As the country seeks to become a top-tier financial player it will be pulled toward the adoption of international norms, and so pressure will fall on Hong Kong to become truly FATF compliant.",1

717,25578,"The Panama Papers showed Hong Kong to be a controlling node in the global network of offshore financial centres which allows individuals and companies to manage legitimate trade-flows and tax optimisation strategies, but also to squirrel away ill-gotten gains.",1
718,25579,"As the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (“ICIJ”) selectively made public leaked documents relating to more than 200,000 offshore entities held by clients of Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca, it emerged that nearly a third of these clients were found to be in Hong Kong and the PRC.",1
719,25580,"The revelation should not be a big surprise as at least a third of direct investment into Hong Kong comes from companies principally based in the British Virgin Islands and Bermuda. There are many reasons to use such offshore booking centres – both legitimate and illegitimate – with some entities clearly using them to evade domestic capital controls in China, and others in Hong Kong benefiting from capturing funds within local stock and property markets.",1
720,25581,"Nevertheless the media spotlight on Hong Kong as a hub for offshore services was not a positive one. What it means in the grand scheme of things is unclear. Anecdotally, fund managers are suggesting the recent stock market slump reflects a general unease in using offshore entities for large investments. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority meanwhile has requested banks to appraise their clients’ exposure to the Mossack Fonseca leaks.",1
721,25582,"In its bid to convince the rest of the world that Hong Kong’s role in the Panama Papers is nothing more than guilt by association, regulatory pressure will likely fall on some of Hong Kong’s weak spots, with money laundering and its ongoing requirement to meet global standards an obvious target.",1
722,25583,"Money flows through Hong Kong are increasingly on policy-makers’ radar. As capital poured into China’s booming economy for most of the last 15 years, its monetary authorities could afford to take a lax approach. The situation has now shifted as China faces capital outflow and the senior leadership is acutely focused on anti-corruption efforts. At the same time, China wants to establish the renminbi as an international currency, epitomised by the International Monetary Fund’s recent decision to include the unit in its “special drawing rights” basket. And in this regard, Hong Kong’s status as an alleged money laundering centre does matter.",1
723,25584,"As a result, the Hong Kong government is acutely sensitive to the issues raised by the Panama Papers. Chan Ka-keung, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, recently defended Hong Kong’s “anti-money laundering’’ credentials within the Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”). Chan noted that politicians and commentators in many developed economies are quick to label countries with low tax rates and more liberal policies as money laundering havens. “This is very wrong’’ he said.",1
724,25585,"One problem is that Hong Kong is the only FATF member with no system of currency declaration or disclosure at its border. After a 2008 evaluation by FATF inspectors revealed shortcomings in its reporting mechanisms, officials agreed to provide biannual updates on its anti-money laundering and terrorist financing efforts. A progress report was given in 2012, but subsequently deadlines have been allowed to slip. Inspectors were due to make a follow up visit in April 2016 according to a disclosure by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, but that has now been bounced to as far back as July 2018 according to the official FATF calendar with a plenary session to discuss findings slated in February 2019.",1
725,25586,"Such a delay will likely be welcomed by the SAR government as Hong Kong’s report card has some hits, but a fair few misses since the FATF’s last assessment in 2012. In the plus corner, both the number and variety of court convictions have risen and financial institutions can point to solid results from giving staff more awareness training; 42,555 suspicious transaction reports were made in 2015 compared to 37,188 in 2014. The momentum has been mainlined this year with 13,297 reports made in the first quarter (seeJoint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1
726,25587,"The number of convictions for money laundering, however, is on a mildly declining trend with 27 in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 122 in 2015, 145 in 2014, 138 in 2013 and 160 in 2012. The value of assets “restrained”, or interceded but not ceased, varies greatly depending on the complexity of the prosecution: in the first quarter of 2016 the figure was a fairly insignificant HK$73.5 million compared to HK$341.5 million in 2015, HK$418.9 million in 2014 and HK$873.4 million in 2013 (seeJoint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1
727,25588,"Moreover, actually seizing assets on behalf of the government has proven difficult. The authorities had a big win in 2013 when HK$645 million was secured, but this masks a generally weak performance. In the first quarter of 2016 just HK$1.3 million was secured versus HK$55 million in 2015 and HK$23.6 million in 2012 (seeJoint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1
728,25589,"At the same time the regulatory focus has widened in recent years. With enactment of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance (Cap. 615) (the “AMLO”) in 2012, law enforcers are increasingly targeting frontline gate-keepers.",1
729,25590,"Shortcomings in customer due diligence have resulted in a number of prosecutions over the past 18 months, with the rate gathering pace. The majority appear to have been money service operators rather than high-profile banks, and the tenor of the charges suggest an initial “low hanging fruit” line of attack.",1
730,25591,"In April 2016, for example, a money service operator was convicted at the Eastern Magistrates’ Court for breaching the licensing requirements of the AMLO, resulting in a fine of HK$4,000. In June 2015, a money service operator was sentenced to 200 hours of community service at Fanling Magistrates’ Court after pleading guilty to 12 charges of failing to comply with the customer due diligence and record-keeping. Other prosecutions have resulted in fines, public reprimands and appeared to result from compliance inspections conducted by Customs & Excise officers.",3
731,25592,"Despite these gains, high-profile legal setbacks may derail Hong Kong’s FATF report card. At the time of going to press, Carson Yeung’s final appeal has been heard at the top court (May 31 to 2 June 2016).",3
732,25593,"Yeung was granted leave to appeal (HKSAR (applicant) v Yeung Ka Sing, Carson (Respondent), FAMC 28&29 of 2015) in August last year. The fact that Yeung was granted bail pending the outcome has prompted optimism among critics of Hong Kong’s “draconian” money laundering laws that a robust overhaul would ensue.",3
733,25594,"Yeung was convicted of five charges of dealing with property known or believed to represent the proceeds of an indictable offence, by using five bank accounts to launder HK$721 million between 2 January 2001 and 31 December 2007, contrary to s. 25(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) (“OSCO”).",1
734,25595,"One of the issues to be dealt with was whether the prosecution must prove that the proceeds (the “property’’) being dealt with in a money laundering charge derives from a criminal act. Heavy criticism has been meted out for the approach taken in Hong Kong. In the UK, the prosecution must prove a predicate offence.",1
735,25596,"One of the questions posed in Yeung’s appeal is whether Oei Hengky Wiryo v SAR (No. 2) (2007) 10 HKCFAR 98 was wrongly decided on this issue. The mens rea for the offence was also under scrutiny and the operation of the rule against duplicity was also to be considered. If it is felt by the CFA that this is not a safe conviction, it remains to be seen in what kind of shape the ordinance emerges. Should prosecutors have to prove a predicate offence, the bar for a conviction would be set significantly higher.",1
736,25597,"In theory, one area of progress Hong Kong should be able to report to the FATF is a system for cross-border currency disclosure, after it was labelled as non-compliant back in 2012 due to an inadequate system for disclosing and declaring cross border transactions.",1
737,25598,"FATF did credit Hong for its April 2012 initiative to adopt a mixed system of declarations for inbound passengers and disclosure for outbound ones, setting the threshold for reporting at HK$120,000. The global watchdog lauded this “fast-track” approach as it expected the legislation to be presented “within 2014.” However, it was not until 2015 that a public consultation was carried out.",1
738,25599,"Given the challenges posed by Hong Kong’s polarised legislature, the fact that lawmakers baulked at the very idea of a declaration system does not bode well for legislation passing any time soon. Already tourism industry figures have spurned the plans as mainland visitors tend to shop using large sums of cash. Lawmaker Christopher Chung Shu-kun commented last year that HK$120,000 “is not even enough to buy a watch.”",1
739,25600,"The latest update came in February 2016 when it was stated that the Security Bureau would collate feedback with a view to implementing the system, although no time frame was given. The impression was given of the issue being left in the long grass.",1
740,25601,"Arguably, it would be easier to focus on Hong Kong’s deep bench of legal and accounting professionals. Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professionals (“DNFBPs”) featured prominently in the 2012 report and in particular the disparity between sanctions the various professions face.",1
741,25602,"It was noted that DNFBPs were reticent to submit reports. There has been progress on this front – while in 2007 there were just nine suspicious transaction reports (“STRs”) by lawyers, three from accountants and five from trust and company service providers (“TCSPs”), in 2015 the legal sector provided 894. The increase for accountants and TCSPs was less impressive, with the professions providing six and 22 STRs respectively in 2015 (for the 2007 figures, see FATF Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong, China, 19 Oct 2012, p. 33; for the 2015 & 2016 figures, see Joint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1
742,25603,"Perhaps the most pressing question is what will be the catalyst to shift Hong Kong’s somewhat anomalous approach to cross-border financial reporting. The betting must be that Beijing will increasingly want to regulate such monetary flows both from the perspective of macro-prudential financial stability and anti-corruption initiatives. As the country seeks to become a top-tier financial player it will be pulled toward the adoption of international norms, and so pressure will fall on Hong Kong to become truly FATF compliant.",1

744,25605,"Oslo, Norway - In the world according to Anders Behring Breivik, a seat on Oslo's city council was once nearly in his grasp - until he was sidelined by a jealous adversary. Nonsense, says the so-called rival, who notes that Breivik attended just five or six party meetings and barely spoke.",1
745,25606,"In his early 20s, Breivik writes, he spent a year working alongside a mentor who schooled him in the ways of business and management. The man calls that a bizarre exaggeration, noting that the only thing he taught Breivik was how to record corporate minutes.",1
746,25607,"Those conflicts between Breivik's account and reality hint at a long thread of delusion winding throughout the 1,518-page manifesto he e-mailed to hundreds of people hours before he set out on a murderous rampage just over a week ago.",1
747,25608,"The killer describes teen years infatuated with hip-hop, sneaking out at night in baggy jeans and hooded sweat shirts to spray-paint buildings around the capital with graffiti under the tag name ""Morg."" Then, Breivik writes, he decided to reject that life and turn himself into a selfless crusader bent on rescuing society from itself.",1
748,25609,"Former friends confirm the tales of schoolboy troublemaking. But they also recall Breivik as the one who repeatedly stepped forward to stop the most popular kids in school from teasing or bullying his classmates. He was a singular boy, reluctant to reveal his own thoughts, but one who would willingly sit for hours in the garden outside a friend's house listening to her talk about herself.",1
749,25610,"""If someone were mean to me he would always stand up for me ... and I think in his head he was just trying to protect us,"" recalls Caroline Fronth, a friend of Breivik's between 7th and 9th grade. ""He was struggling to find his path and we all did in our class ... and that's what's terrible here, because he found his way.""",1
750,25611,"According to Breivik's manifesto, he plotted for nearly nine years to carry out his attack. Investigators say that they have found no signs of a larger conspiracy and that he does not appear to have shared his plans with anyone.",1
751,25612,"Then, on July 22, he parked a van loaded with a bomb made from fertilizer outside government offices in central Oslo. It exploded, killing eight. Less than two hours later, Breivik walked into a youth political camp on an island outside the city, dressed as a policeman and armed with a handgun and a modified semiautomatic rifle, and embarked on a rampage, shooting his victims twice.",3
752,25613,"Breivik, 32, claims he carried out the attacks as part of a network of modern-day crusaders - the Knights Templar - to launch a revolution against a Europe spoiled by Muslim immigration, and that there are other cells ready to strike.",3
753,25614,"In the days since the attacks, Norwegians - especially those who knew Breivik - have puzzled over his motives and his mindset, trying to reconcile the deeds with a life that, outwardly at least, seemed quite ordinary.",1
754,25615,What snapped inside Breivik that so warped his perception of self and society he would slaughter 77 of his countrymen in the name of saving them? Retracing his story hints at a troubling set of possible answers.,3
755,25616,"In the manifesto, Breivik waxes fondly for the Europe of old, full of fathers who dutifully went off to work every morning and mothers who stayed at home and knew their place. The reality of his own life was quite different. Both of his parents worked full-time and they divorced when he was one. His father remarried and, as a Norwegian consular official, lived mostly outside the country.",1
756,25617,"His mother, a nurse who also remarried, won custody, raising her son in a first-floor apartment on the west side of Oslo, generally considered the most fashionable and affluent part of the city. But Fronth - who along with Breivik was part of a group of five friends who spent hours together - says Breivik chafed at the differences between himself and classmates from families with more money.",2
757,25618,"The red brick apartment building, where his mother Wenche Behring still lives, fronts a busy street that has been redeveloped with office buildings in recent years. But at the time, the street was scruffy compared to nearby neighborhoods and decidedly working class, Fronth says. It contrasted sharply with the blocks of neatly tended homes with red tile roofs, sitting behind walls Breivik passed on the walk to Ris junior high school.",1
758,25619,"At school, Breivik did not have many friends, but he was hardly anti-social, said Michael Tomala, a former classmate. Breivik spent hours lifting weights, often with a friend, Arsalan Ahmad Sohail, the son of a Pakistani immigrant family, leaving the pair of boys bigger than many of their classmates. Sohail's father and wife said this week that he would not comment on his relationship with Breivik.",1
759,25620,"""Not only once, but a few times, he would come in between conflicts ... He would actually stop a fight and say, look, leave him alone, he hasn't done anything,"" Tomala said. ""I remember him as having a grown-up way of doing things.""",1
760,25621,Tomala says that attitude extended to conversations with Breivik. He recalled one during which Breivik encouraged him to stand up to classmates who were giving him a hard time for devoting so much energy to training for the track and field team.,1
761,25622,"Tomala and Fronth say that Breivik and other boys in class began sneaking out at night to paint graffiti. Fronth, who recalls being asked to keep watch while the boys wielded the paint cans, says Breivik was very impressionable, trying to prove his worth by doing what the most popular classmates did.",1
762,25623,"""It was hard for us to get into his head,"" Fronth said. ""I think he was pretty intelligent, but he didn't show emotion. He didn't smile much or ever cry. He was just there all the time. It was really hard to figure out who he was.""",1
763,25624,"Breivik had been visiting his father, Jens, and new wife regularly over the years. But when he was about 15, all contact ceased. Fronth says she could tell that bothered her friend. In his manifesto, Breivik writes that he didn't have ""any negative experiences"" in his childhood. But he suggests that his father was upset with his graffiti sprees.",1
764,25625,"""He wasn't happy about that relationship since he didn't have any contacts,"" said Tove Overmo, Jens Breivik's second wife, who stayed in touch with her husband's son even after they were divorced. ""I think he had a wish to have contact with his father.""",1
765,25626,"Breivik writes that starting when he was 15, gangs of Muslim teens increasingly threatened him and his classmates and that he confronted them, a contention that is hard to verify, but that he says was formative to his anti-Muslim views.",2
766,25627,"""I was at a party on Tasen when we heard they had just beaten on of my friend's younger brothers. We went to chase them away from the neighborhood. They had weapons, we had weapons. I was hit with a billiard pool in the head. Result of the fight: we made a deal with them. They promised they would never return and harass the Tasen youngsters again,"" he writes.",2
767,25628,"After graduating from high school, Breivik worked in a series of jobs, including at a call center and a bank. But parts of the account in his manifesto appear to vastly inflate his accomplishments and experience. In 2000 and 2001, he writes of spending a year working alongside ""mentor"" Richard Steenfeldt Berg as a consultant hired by his company, Hypertec AS. Berg coached him in management, administration and business development, Breivik writes.",1
768,25629,"But Berg, who says the pair knew each other for just a few months and that contact with Breivik consisted of a ""limited number of visits"" to his office, sharply disputes the characterization of the relationship.",1
769,25630,"""Yes, I met this monster 11 years ago. No, I did not coach him in any subjects, except for some advice on writing corporate minutes protocol, which he requested fervently,"" Berg says in an open letter he posted this week on his Facebook page. ""No, I have never acted as, nor accepted the role of, any kind of 'mentor' for him.""",2
770,25631,"Two years later, Breivik writes, he was nominated by the Progress Party to run for a seat on the Oslo city council and ""came relatively close to being elected."" But according to the manifesto, those aspirations were stonewalled by ""my rival"" Joran Kallmyr, who was chairman of the party's youth wing and is now a vice mayor of Oslo.",1
771,25632,"""I barely remember him,"" Kallmyr said in an interview. Breivik attended just five or six meetings of the youth party, his presence unremarkable except for the fact that he was the only one wearing a tie, Kallmyr said.",1
772,25633,"In 2002, Breivik writes, he started the first of a few business ventures, a software outsourcing company. At about the same time, he says he began laying plans for radical action, concluding that working through traditional political channels would be fruitless.",1
773,25634,"Three years later, he writes, the company had grown into a successor firm that employed seven people, but he was secretly using it as a front, ""with the purpose of financing resistance/liberation related military operations.""",1
774,25635,"In May 2009, government records show, Breivik started his final venture, a sole proprietorship called Breivik Geofarm that listed its business as ""growing of vegetables, melons, roots and tubers."" The company's name is still printed below Breivik's mother's name on the bell outside her apartment building's ivy-draped doorway.",1
775,25636,"In June of 2010, he renewed a membership in the Oslo Pistol Club, a shooter's practice range that sits at the end of a gravel road in the woods outside the city. The club said in a note posted on its website this week that Breivik had previously been a member from 2005 to 2007. Gun ownership is tightly restricted in Norway, but relatively common, reflecting the popularity of hunting.",1
776,25637,"""The club, like other similar clubs, has no role in evaluating potential members' suitability as weapons owners beyond what we observe on the range,"" the club said in its note, which expressed the group's grief for the victims. Breivik participated in 13 organized training sessions and one shooting competition since rejoining last year, the club said.",1
777,25638,"According to his manifesto and to investigators, Breivik used the Geofarm business as a front earlier this year to buy the fertilizer and other chemicals required to make the bomb. He used two guns during his rampage on Utoya island, both of which police say he bought legally.",1
778,25639,"But Breivik wrote that he had said nothing to friends and family about his views or intentions, telling them only that he was working on new business ventures, including one that involved farming, and that he was nearing completion of a book he had been researching for many years.",1
779,25640,"""If I'd had some kind of suspicion, some kind of idea that something was not right with him, it would have been easier I think,"" she said. ""He left saying...see you again soon or something like that - something very normal.""",1
780,25641,"""Regime sub-leaders such as her are on auto pilot, though, and partly disconnected from reality and thus partly unaware of their own war crimes,"" he wrote in the manifesto just before the visit - and four months before he launched his attack.",1

837,25698,"Even more serious is the main criticism of Rushton by Alland (2002), who devotes a chapter to Rushton in his book. According to Alland, Rushton and all the scientists who provide quoted support for his book in the inside cover of the third edition – his “coterie of admirers” (161), which includes famous race researchers such as Arthur Jensen, Hans Eysenck, and Charles Murray – received generous research grants from the Pioneer Fund. This organization, Alland is quick to point out, is “noted for its support of racist research,” it had in its earliest years “praised aspects of Nazi Germany’s racial policies” (8), [and some more along these lines].",1
838,25699,"Whether these allegations are true or not, it does not really matter, since, from a logical point of view, they commit at least three fallacies when used, as they are by Alland, to reject and argument, in this case Rushton’s evolutionary argument for racial differences. The first is the genetic fallacy, […] The next is guilt by association. […] Finally, there is circumstantial ad hominem. A person’s motive in making an argument, whether that motive is conscious or not, has no bearing whatsoever on the logical worth of the argument. An argument is an autonomous entity, and it needs to be analyzed accordingly, in terms of whether the premises are true, relevant, and sufficient. The motive of the person who provided the argument is totally irrelevant. All of these points are readily available in books on what is known as informal logic, and students will readily agree with them when they examine them in theory and see them applied to mundane examples, but it all has a habit of going out the window in the context of hot topics such as race (others are feminism and religion). […]",1
839,25700,"At this point my own motives have probably come under suspicion, but I really do not care. My only desire has been to argue that, from an evolutionary point of view, there is nothing inherently mistaken or wrongheaded, let alone evil, in supposing that there are racial (geographic, cladistic, or ecotypic) differences in IQ or in other character traits within wide-ranging species such as Homo sapiens. Any aversion to research in this area is basically socially and politically motivated, it is not biologically motivated. At the end of the day, when all is said and done, it remains possible – indeed, quite possible – that from a modern evolutionary point of view there are innate statistical differences, even significant differences, in aptitude and behavior between different human races. […] Equal opportunity combined with a positive environment is the moral imperative. But we should not let the value of this imperative fool us into believing that biology makes us equal. Like it or not, biology just does not work that way. We need to be realistic, and to remember that we are always dealing with statistical phenomena. At any rate, for my own part, I prefer to rest content with the wisdom of Martin Luther King, Jr., who said it is not the color of a man’s skin that matters but the content of his character. Truer words were never spoken, possibly even if repeated from an evolutionary point of view.",1
840,25701,"Finally, there are political reasons for why many find the SSSM appealing and are immediately suspicious of, or will not even listen to, those who provide evolutionary perspectives on human nature. At the core of it all is political correctness, with its goal of a sensitive and fair society, especially with regard to groups that have suffered and continue to suffer discrimination and oppression. While among the general public there is a lot of division over the value of political correctness, with many thinking it has gone too far (just listen to call-in radio talk shows), in colleges and universities, especially in the humanities and social sciences, it has become quite a dominant force, even to the point of censorship (in many colleges and universities in the United States, for example, racial theorizing is not allowed). While the basic reasons for political correctness are just and laudable, much politically correct thinking is arguably unrealistic and a form of denial. Nowhere is this plainer than in the big questions where biology should be clearly relevant. Indeed, politically correct thinkers routinely give the impression that they could not care less about being biologically correct. If there is a conflict between political correctness and biology, then too bad for biology. What we shall see in coming chapters is that political correctness, when it shuts itself off from empirical evidence and argument or flies too easily to the SSSM, easily becomes its own worst enemy. To give a quick example, it can now be argued that the communist experiment failed, in country after country around the world, just as every commune experiment of hippies in the 1960s failed, not necessarily because evil or stupid people were behind the experiments, but because they had the wrong theory of human nature. How many other grand visions of human happiness are destined to fail because they have an erroneous concept of human nature?",1

911,25772,"Background and objectives The safety of percutaneous endovascular declotting procedures for thrombosed hemodialysis fistulae/grafts is well described in the general population; however, its safety in the presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) is not known. The objective of this study is to assess the incidence of symptomatic paradoxical embolic events associated with declotting procedure of thrombosed arteriovenous (AV) graft or fistula in patients with documented PFO.",1
912,25773,"Design, setting, participants, & measurements This was a retrospective study in a hospital-based, academic practice. It included 23 patients (10 men; mean age, 65) with PFO and thrombosed hemodialysis graft/fistula who underwent a standardized declotting procedure with 2 mg of Alteplase and balloon thrombectomy. Twenty patients (87%) had AV grafts, and three (13%) had AV fistulae. The PFO shunt was right to left in two (9%), left to right in eight (34%), and bidirectional in ten (44%). The shunt direction was not specified in three patients (13%). The technical success of the declotting procedure and the frequency of clinically manifested paradoxical embolic events in this patient population were calculated.",1
913,25774,"Results Fifty declotting procedures were performed on 23 patients with a technical success rate of 96% (48 of 50, 96%). No symptomatic paradoxical embolic events were found in any of the 23 patients with PFO.",1
914,25775,Conclusions Symptomatic paradoxical embolic events after percutaneous endovascular declotting procedures of thrombosed AV grafts and fistulae in patients with documented PFO are rare. This procedure appears to be safe in patients with a PFO.,1
915,25776,"A functioning arteriovenous access is critical for patients with ESRD who receive hemodialysis. These arteriovenous accesses are predominantly arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) or arteriovenous grafts (AVG), collectively referred as AVFG in this manuscript, although a few patients are served with long term hemodialysis catheters (1). Often, the AVFG are complicated by outflow obstruction and thrombosis (2). Current data support the use of percutaneous endovascular techniques to restore patency of the AVFG (3). A percutaneous declotting procedure refers to endovascular thrombectomy of the AVFG using mechanical devices (such as balloons or suction catheters) either with or without concurrent use of thrombolytic agents. During this procedure, the thrombus in the AVFG and outflow veins is often pushed into the central veins. This may result in subclinical pulmonary embolism (PE), although symptomatic PE is occasionally reported (4,5). Many reports have established the safety of this procedure in the general population with no documented cardiac septal defects (4,5). However, the safety of this procedure in patients with documented patent foramen ovale (PFO) is not known. Patients with PFO are at risk of paradoxical embolism, and a few studies have reported occurrence of stroke in these patients, especially after a transient increase in the right heart pressures (6–8). Given the high incidence of subclinical PE during declotting of thrombosed AVFG and consequent elevated right heart pressures, there is real concern of paradoxical embolism in patients with PFO. In this study, we seek to assess the incidence of symptomatic paradoxical embolic events after percutaneous endovascular declotting of thrombosed AVFG in patients with documented PFO.",1
916,25777,"This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement to obtain the informed consent was waived. The study was Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant. Patients who underwent a percutaneous endovascular declotting procedure for a thrombosed AVFG between January 2003 and December 2008 and had a documented PFO were included in this study. Our interventional database (HI-IQ software, ConexSys, RI) was interrogated to identify patients who had a declotting procedure during this period. The electronic medical records were reviewed for the presence of PFO. Only patients who had PFO on a contrast-enhanced echocardiography were included in this study.",1
917,25778,"During the study period (January 2003 to December 2008), 484 percutaneous endovascular declotting procedures were performed on 238 patients. An echocardiogram was available in 171 patients, and 23 (23 of 171, 13.4%) patients had PFO. These patients constituted our study population. There were 10 men and 13 women with an average age of 65 years. Twenty patients (20 of 23, 87%) had AVG, and three (three of 23, 13%) had AVF. The location of the AVF and AVG in these 23 patients is as follows. Three patients had AVFs: two had (two of 23, 9%) radiocephalic fistulae, and one (one of 23, 4%) had a brachiocepalic fistula. Twenty patients had AVGs: three (three of 23; 13%) had radiocephalic grafts; seven (seven of 23; 30%) had brachiocephalic grafts; three (three of 23, 13%) had brachiobasilic grafts; four (four of 20, 17%) had brachioaxillary grafts; and three patients (three of 23, 13%) had grafts at other locations. A total of 50 declotting procedures were performed in these 23 patients (average of 2.2 procedures/patient) during the study period (Table 1 and Fig. 1).",1
918,25779,"Echocardiography was retrieved from our electronic medical records, and the report was reviewed. The results of echocardiography were recorded for direction of flow across the PFO. This assessment was made on color Doppler study in 14 (14 of 23, 60%), agitated saline bubble study in seven (seven of 23, 30%), and on both methods in two (two of 23, 10%). The shunt was right to left in two (two of 23, 9%), left to right in eight (eight of 23, 34%), and bidirectional in ten (ten of 23, 44%). The shunt direction was not specified in three (three of 23, 13%) (Table 2).",1
919,25780,"In all of the patients, the declotting procedure was performed using a standard technique. After obtaining an informed consent from the patient, the AVG or AVF was accessed at the arterial end with the needle directed toward the outflow with an 18-G angiocath, and 2 mg of alteplase and 2000 units of heparin were injected. After 1 hour, the patient was brought to an angiosuite, and the AVG- or AVF-bearing arm was prepped and draped. The angiocath was exchanged for a 7Fr sheath over a glide wire. A 5Fr Kumpe catheter was advanced in to the subclavian vein, and venography was performed to assess the patency of the central veins. Angioplasty of the venous outflow stenoses, if any, was performed using appropriately sized balloons. Then the thrombus was pushed in to the central veins with angioplasty balloon. Next, the venous end of the AVG/AVF was accessed, and a 6Fr sheath was placed. A 0.035-inch glide wire was inserted and passed through the arterial anastomosis in to the artery. The thrombus plug at the anastomosis was removed using a 5.5Fr Fogarty balloon. Angioplasty of the arterial anastomosis was performed if a stenosis was identified. The declotting procedure was considered technically successful with return of thrill in the graft or fistula. The sheaths were removed, and hemostasis was achieved through purse-string sutures. As per the department protocol for patients with a PFO, a detailed neurologic examination was performed by a board-certified physician for assessment of stroke after every declotting procedure. The presence of any neurologic deficit was recorded and followed with a neurology consult. If there were no neurologic deficits, the patient was discharged from the hospital. All of the patients were informed about the risk of stroke and were requested to go to the hospital emergency room if symptoms of stroke developed after leaving the hospital.",1
920,25781,"The data were collected from the medical and imaging regards. Paradoxical embolic events such as stroke, myocardial infarction, limb ischemia, visceral ischemia, etc., were recorded if they occurred within 48 hours of the declotting procedure. If a patient had any imaging study (such computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) for ischemic symptoms, the results were reviewed, and the findings were recorded.",1
921,25782,The technical success of the declotting procedure in this patient population was calculated. This was compared with the technical success of the declotting procedure for all comers in our division (484 procedures in 238 patients during this time). The frequency of paradoxical embolic events in this population was calculated.,1
922,25783,"As mentioned earlier, 23 patients with PFO underwent 50 declotting procedures during the period of study. Forty-eight (48 of 50, 96%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 91.12% to 99.98%) declotting procedures were successful. Two declotting procedures, one in a patient with an AVF and another in a patient with an AVG, were unsuccessful. In comparison, the technical success of all of the declotting procedures during this period was 97% (471 of 484 procedures in 238 patients; 95% CI, 95.87% to 98.75%).",1
923,25784,"There were no symptomatic paradoxical embolic events (0%; 95% CI, 0% to 7.1%) after the declotting procedure in any of the patients with PFO. No patients had imaging studies within 48 hours of a declotting procedure. No patients succumbed to death within this period (48-hour mortality, 0%).",1
924,25785,"With the increasing prevalence of ESRD and the consequent rise in hemodialysis, maintenance of a proper vascular access through AVF or AVG has assumed a great importance (9). AVF and AVG are often complicated with recurrent venous stenosis and thrombosis and necessitate frequent interventions through angioplasty and thrombolysis (3,10). Endovascular recanalization procedures are often complicated by bleeding, vein rupture, PE, and downstream arterial embolization (11). The volume of thrombus during declotting procedures is relatively high, although it is still small compared with the large size of the pulmonary arterial bed (5). Subclinical PE during declotting procedures is common, but symptomatic PE is rare (4). One study reported 35% incidence of PE on perfusion scintigraphy after endovascular declotting of thrombosed AVG and AVF, although only 4% were symptomatic (12). Clinical and subclinical PE result in elevation of pulmonary artery and right heart pressures, although such changes rarely lead to cardiopulmonary compromise (13). However, such elevations in right heart pressure may alter the flow direction through a PFO and potentially lead to paradoxical embolism (14).",1
925,25786,"Given the high incidence of PFO in general population (up to 34%) and its association with stroke in the young (8,15–17), it is important to know the safety of endovascular declotting procedures in patients with a history of untreated PFO. There are only a few case reports of paradoxical emboli secondary to endovascular declotting procedure for thrombosed AVFG (14,18,19). It is hypothesized that such a low incidence of paradoxical embolic events in these patients is secondary to a low incidence of right to left shunt or intermittent nature of the shunt with low volume of blood being transferred (16,20). Similar to the reported studies, our study documented no systemic embolic events during endovascular declotting procedures in patients with echocardiography confirmed PFO. The flow direction across the PFO had no influence in the occurrence of systemic embolic events.",1
926,25787,"Our study documented the safety of declotting procedures in patients with PFO. As such, patients undergoing declotting procedures may not necessitate a formal echocardiography to rule out the presence of PFO, although a large multi-center study is useful to confirm the preliminary findings of our study. In addition, whether such a recommendation can be applied for surgical thrombectomy needs further clinical studies.",1
927,25788,"The main limitations of our study are the retrospective nature and the small patient-sample size. Although a prospective trial with a larger number of patients would be highly useful, our study provided follow-up during multiple declotting procedures.",1

989,25850,"A feeding hawk, a sculpture of a fallen robot, and chalk markings pointing to a slave cemetery-each of these objects was unexpectedly encountered during walking interviews on a college campus. This article explores these object encounters in turn as provocations toward the potential for walking as a method to generate interventions in the reproduction of hegemonic spaces. Specifically, this paper takes up the Deleuzoguattarian concepts of the rhizome and the assemblage to explore how the practice of walking makes possible creative and imaginative explorations in the relationship between objects and place. Methodologically, walking produces the possibility for affirmative difference in the interview, a positive embrace of reading objects as complex and connected through an embodied enactment of rhizomes and assemblages. Inquiry that thinks with rhizomes and assemblages connects disparate encounters, moments, and objects through affirmative difference, embracing connections and relations. This article suggests implications for how the walking interview might engender reflective entanglements of theory and methodology, resist extractive methods, as well as produce imaginative reconceptualisations of place, and interventions and disruptions of hegemonic narratives.",1

999,25860,"This article explores the hermeneutical challenges to understand religious belonging and religious identity in the East Asian context. In East Asia, religious identities have not always been as exclusively delineated, as is the case in Western models of religious diversity, for example in the so-called World Religions paradigm. Various theoretical frameworks are discussed in religious studies, sociology and anthropology of religion in China and East Asia, to acquire a better understanding of religious belonging. It is observed that two hermeneutical frameworks are used by scholars to discuss religious diversity: a hermeneutics of multiple religions and a hermeneutics of religiosity. The former analyses ""religious belonging"" as a ""belonging to religious traditions"". In the latter, ""religious belonging"" is understood as transcending particular religious traditions. It is argued that we need to take another look at the philosophical concept of ""multiplicity"" to understand religious diversity and religious belonging. We can use the Deleuzian concepts of ""rhizome"" and ""assemblage"" to describe religious belongings in East Asia specifically and also religion in general. A rhizomatic thinking about religion enables us to reimagine the concept of religious belonging as rhizomatic belonging, and also, as is argued by Haiyan Lee and Mayfair Yang, make it possible to subvert power structures inherent to religion.",1

It is important to notice and examine these tensions as many art educators use qualitative research design and methods. Subsequently, more attention is needed to recognizing research as an emotional and often conflicted process. Informing this inquiry is the work of multi-disciplinary scholars who discuss the concept of ‘in-between’ and ‘Third Space’ as integral to disrupting binary thinking. Additionally, other strategies are presented that support relational thinking in qualitative research and the creation of rhizomatic research cultures.",1

1004,25865,"This paper contributes to conversations taking place around new materialist feminist interventions and embodied methodologies related to the rhetorics of everyday life. Historically, the Western metaphysical sensorium has tended to privilege the bodily uprightness of humans with their head and the senses associated with it (e.g., vision and cognition) as sovereign authorities for rational decision making. This metaphysical system ascribes a generally abject passivity to vegetal life on account of its stationary emplacement in the earth, compared to the active human capacity of ambulation (Marder). In an attempt to de-hierarchize and re-map such exclusionary logics of experience, this paper advances the concept of detour de force, a mobile, embodied orientation to rhetorical research that models an ethic of creeping persistence inspired predominantly by vegetal movement. A detour de force suggests a sexually differentiated orientation enfolding haptic, aural, gustatory, and olfactory modes of embodied judgment (alongside the ocular) within rhetorical fieldwork. ​",1

I present sargassum as a replacement for the concept of the rhizome, which fails to adequately function within an aquatic context since as a terrestrial metaphor the rhizome cannot capture the ocean's fluidity and circulation. Replacing a terrestrial figure with an oceanic one allows for a richer understanding of connection and loss, since the migratory sargassum is able to conceptually entangle disparate cultures, while also attending to the histories, and gaps in histories, contained within the oceanic abyss. It is within this context that the article considers a variety of works, including Romare Bearden's collage "" The Sea Nymph "" from the series Black Odyssey, Derek Walcott's poem "" The Bounty, "" and M.

I ground this discussion in disputes over cultural pluralism occasioned by The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Music, edited by Nicholas Cook and Anthony Pople in 2004. What would it mean, I ask, to reclaim organicism as a way of understanding the proliferation, cultivation, and complex multiplicity of sonic practices across the globe? Can we move beyond prior conceptions of the natural to arrive at a new history of musical experience both radically democratic and more in tune with hybridity, interconnection, heterogeneity, and unpredictable flux?

The questions arose as to whether or not a provision in the Motor Accidents Act 1988 of New South Wales which limited the amount of damages which could be recovered in respect of non-economic loss was a substantive rule to be applied as part of the lex causae. Held: In relation to questions of the quantification of damage, anything beyond the ascertainment of the heads of liability is a procedural question, and thus referring to a New South Wales statute: ""section 79 is plainly a provision which affects the measure of damages but does not touch the heads of liability in respect of which damages might be awarded.

The car careered down the slope and Mr Hall was seriously injured. Held: The illegality of his driving did not bar his claim against Mr Hebert but that he was contributorily negligent as to 50%. McLachlin J discussed the need for a consistent and defensible principle for the operation of the doctrine ex turpi causa: ""a need in the law of tort for a principle which permits judges to deny recovery to a plaintiff on the ground that to do so would undermine the integrity of the justice system. The power is a limited one. Its use is justified where allowing the plaintiff's claim would introduce inconsistency into the fabric of the law, either by permitting the plaintiff to profit from an illegal or wrongful act, or to evade a penalty prescribed by criminal law. Its use is not justified where the plaintiff's claim is merely for compensation for personal injuries sustained as a consequence of the negligence of the defendant."" He explained the principle, saying that: ""to allow recovery in these cases would be to allow recovery for what is illegal. It would put the courts in the position of saying that the same conduct is both legal, in the sense of being capable of rectification by the court, and illegal. It would, in short, introduce an inconsistency in the law. It is particularly important in this context that we bear in mind that the law must aspire to be a unified institution, the parts of which - contract, tort, the criminal law - must be in essential harmony. For the courts to punish conduct with the one hand while rewarding it with the other, would be to 'create an intolerable fissure in the law's conceptually seamless web': Weinrib - ""Illegality as a Tort Defence"" (1976) 26 U.T.L.J. 28 at p. 42.

1118,25979,"Bribes were taken by an employee, a crown prosecutor in Hong Kong, in a fraud on his employer. He then invested the proceeds in the purchase of property in New Zealand. The property had increased in value. The employer sought repayment of the bribes received from the properties purchased. Held: The employer had a proprietary interest both in the bribe and in the asset substituted for it. Thus the property belonged in equity to the employer. The first stage in the analysis was the decision that the bribe itself was trust property. The second stage in the analysis was simply the application of the process of tracing the value of the bribe into the asset that had been substituted for it. A fiduciary office holder who accepted a bribe holds both the original sum, and any increase in its value, on a constructive trust for the person to whom he owed that fiduciary duty. Bribery is an evil practice which threatens the foundations of any civilised society. It corrupts not only the recipient but the giver of the bribe. ""property acquired by a trustee innocently but in breach of trust and the property from time to time representing the same belong in equity to the cestui que trust and not to the trustee personally"":",1

1304,33637,"The proposal for the extradition bill has been steeped in controversy. It started when Chan Tong-kai, 20, a citizen of Hong Kong, admitted to killing his girlfriend in Taiwan last year. Chan, who has since returned to Hong Kong, has only been charged in Hong Kong for money laundering (he allegedly used his murdered girlfriend's stolen credit card). The Taiwanese government has urged Hong Kong to send Chan back for trial, but the Hong Kong government refused, according to the South China Morning Post.",3
1305,33638,"“The extradition bill does a key thing -- it undermines the validity and legitimacy of the Hong Kong legal system,” Winnie King, a specialist in Chinese international political economy and international relations at the University of Bristol, told ABC News. “One of the key central pillars of Hong Kong's identity and history, it is at the foundation of the island's strengths (be it for international business and contract law, but also for the protection of its own citizens), the extradition bill illustrates how China's influence is no longer 'creeping' in nature.”",1

1307,33640,"“The bill is controversial in my view for emotional reasons,” according to Tim Summers, a former diplomat and senior consulting fellow on the Asia-Pacific program at Chatham House, which is based in Hong Kong. “It brings to the fore distrust of the authorities in mainland China and highlights differences between Hong Kong’s robust rule of law and the more arbitrary system in mainland China.”",1
1308,33641,"The mass demonstrations have been organized by a group called Civil Human Rights Front, but the sheer numbers involved on Sunday (one million people, according to the organizers), shows that the issue is supported by a cross-section of Hong Kong society.",1
1309,33642,"“Protests are a regular feature of politics in Hong Kong,” Summers said. “The vast majority of these are peaceful and pass off without incident. These protests had wide support across society, so many people just turned up. There was widespread publicity about the protests in advance and people share info rapidly on social media.”",1

With real implications for Taiwan, the international community would (and should) be very interested to see where this leads.”",1
1313,33646,"However, introduction of the extradition laws is ""ill-advised and unnecessary,"" according to Tsang, who said it reflects the top down approach of policy making by Chinese Premier Xi Jinping.

Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam expects the amendment to be made before July this year.",1
1335,33668,"It was in February that the Hong Kong government proposed the amendment. However, the administration built up support for the amendment by pointing to a murder case. In 2018, Hong Kong resident Chan Tong-kai had killed his 20-year-old girlfriend during a trip to Taiwan. Though authorities arrested Chan, they were unable to prosecute him in Hong Kong since they couldn’t charge him with murder in the local courts.",2
1336,33669,Chan is due to be sentenced by the last week of April on charges of stealing money from his dead girlfriend. It is believed that he could walk free. The only way to ensure that Chan gets punished for the murder is to extradite him to Taiwan where he can be booked for manslaughter. This is why Chief Executive Lam is pushing to pass the amendment as early as possible.,3
1337,33670,"“This ‘deadline’ is not July, rather I hope it is earlier than July… The case had already been taken to court, and is due for sentencing later, therefore [Chan’s release] may be earlier than July… Since we have already introduced the legislation to provide that legal basis, the question now is not entirely for us. It’s for the Legislative Council to also display that same sort of compassion and empathy and try to speed up the legislative exercise to give us that legal basis to proceed,” she said in a statement (Hong Kong Free Press).",1
1338,33671,"The proposed amendment has been met with strong opposition from human rights activists. They claim that the government is using the murder case as a pretext to bring in more laws that would strengthen Beijing’s control over the city.

The bill was not being withdrawn, however, she clarified, and insisted its objectives were good for Hong Kong.",1
1356,33689,"The announcement came after a week that saw thousands of young people occupy the city’s central government district in scenes reminiscent of 2014’s pro-democracy protests, known as the Umbrella Movement, demanding the law be scrapped.

1358,33691,"The need to amend the city’s current extradition laws, which don’t allow for suspects to be sent to the mainland, ostensibly arose earlier this year because of the case of a Hong Kong man, Chan Tong-kai, who murdered his pregnant girlfriend in Taiwan, and then returned here, where he could not be tried for murder. Now serving time on money-laundering charges for misusing his girlfriend’s ATM card in Hong Kong, he confessed in court to the killing.",3

1360,33693,"Some commentators believe that Lam’s announcement is likely a face-saving way to withdraw the bill, without actually doing so. In the case of the reviled 2003 legislation, for example, meetings on the bill were canceled and eventually it lapsed and was never taken up again.",1
1361,33694,"Hong Kong’s struggles against this bill have been a remarkable lesson in the resilience required to face creeping authoritarianism. Protesters focused on the vital role of taking action to be heard, rather than dwelling on the likely outcome. One protester among the many who were out last Sunday said he was not hopeful the government would listen to them. But he said he had to come out regardless, calling the struggle against the bill the “last fight” for Hong Kong.",1
1362,33695,"As recently as Monday, Lam vowed to press ahead with the bill a day after a million people gathered against it—but the tide turned after Occupy 2.0. Taking questions for about an hour after her remarks, Lam several times dodged questions on whether she would resign for her missteps in the process, and for the chaos the city saw this past week.",1
1363,33696,"Lam also would not criticize the police force’s response to the protests, which many condemned as heavy-handed. Last night thousands of mothers gathered in central Hong Kong, carrying placards that said “don’t shoot our children.” Instead, she said the protesters had engaged in violence, and that police were taking defensive action.",1
1364,33697,"Today’s concession appears to have come too late to defuse tensions—anger remains over police actions, and many in the city were unhappy with her remarks, and her continued efforts to defend the bill. If anything, it also showed the effectiveness of more radical action, given the climbdown came after Wednesday’s street occupation, and not after the larger and more peaceful march a week ago. Another march has been called for Sunday (June 16).",1

1368,33701,"The discussion for the Extradition Bill came about last year, after Chan Tong-kai murdered his Hong Kong girlfriend while they were on vacation together in Taiwan. However, Taiwan was unable to charge Chan before he flew back to Hong Kong. This new bill would thus ensure that he would be able to stand trail within Taiwan, not his native homeland, Hong Kong. Right now, Chan is taking advantage of a massive loophole in the system. Since there was no extradition present between the two countries, Chan did not stand trial in Taiwan, although he was supposed to. Due to not being tried in Taiwan, the only crimes Chan could be accused of were fraud and theft, meaning that his jail time actually ends in October. He could not be charged with murder in Hong Kong.",3
1369,33702,"That’s not to say that the extradition bill would be all positive. In fact, the new bill could prove detrimental for Hong Kong. If passed, Chinese mainland officials would be able to take whoever they wanted, charging them with a legal offense. The charges could range from business offenses to political dissidents. This bill would allow for crimes in Hong Kong to be tried in the mainland, and would be detrimental toward Hong Kong’s current mainly autonomous legal system. Additionally, the lawmakers in charge of this bill have made it clear that there is absolutely no guarantee of a free trial if residents are extradited to other areas of mainland China.",1
1370,33703,"The bill could be detrimental to many local businesses in Hong Kong. Last year, booksellers from Hong Kong who were smuggling illegal books from Hong Kong to China were taken in by custody. Lam Wing-kee was abducted and harassed by Chinese police officers for months on end because he would smuggle banned books into the mainland. Without the extradition bill, Chinese officers had no right to charge Lam, rather, acting illegally. However, with the presence of the extradition bill, China would have the full rights to conduct trials and hold people like Lam custody within the mainland. China’s growing aggression toward Hong Kong and people’s freedom is why they’ve perfectly timed this bill. As China’s economy grows more prosperous and leadership grows more strict, it’s important that they start to fully eradicate the ideas of free thought. With this in mind, there’s no question that the new extradition bill would be the key to kickstarting China’s one-minded system, and would act as the beginning of the end for Hong Kong’s current autonomy.",1
1371,33704,"Not only would the bill affect Hong Kong’s practical autonomy, but it would also destroy their economy. Countries like the USA have made it clear that they would end partnerships with Hong Kong if the bill were to be passed, citing high tensions with China, among other factors. There’s no doubt that this would absolutely lead to a breakdown in Taiwan’s economy. In western countries, this bill is viewed as a possible “communist threat”. Hong Kong, which relies on international involvement to maintain its steadily growing economy, would struggle tremendously if the bill was passed. Leaders from the US, along with other countries, met with Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to discuss the detriments behind the passing of the extradition bill.",1
1372,33705,"Despite the meeting and protests, Lam has decided to push forward with the bill, to many’s dismay. However, that doesn’t mean that the people are going to fall that easily. Although the bill could plug a loophole that would help out some, in the end, it throws Hong Kong’s current justice system up into the air. Authorities, businesses, and everyday people may all be affected by this bill, not to mention the economic and international connections that would be ruined by the bill. However, on the opposite end, the bill would bring peace of mind to families like those of the murdered Hong Kong girl, by finally ensuring her justice. But it’s not hard to say that for Hong Kong residents, this is the bill that might revoke their freedom. The protest is one of the biggest seen, comparable to when Hong Kong gained independence from the British. But Lam’s current agreement won’t stop the people of Hong Kong, who will continue to fight for their autonomy and their justice.",1

1396,33729,"The Hong Kong Security Bureau recently proposed an amendment to the extradition ordinance that would allow the government to send fugitives to China and Taiwan to be tried on a case-by-case basis. If it is passed, any fugitive from the law who sets foot in Hong Kong could be tried and imprisoned in the mainland if a request is made and Hong Kong consents. Local lawyers say the proposal is more severe than the unimplemented Article 23 of the Basic Law, which was to legislate against subversion and secession. Human rights campaigners said Article 23 was aimed at being used to curtail protest movements. The move to change the extradition law was triggered by a controversial murder case that occurred in Taiwan in February 2018. Chan Tong-kai, who was 19 at the time, was suspected of killing his pregnant girlfriend, Poon Hiu-wing, while they were on vacation to celebrate Valentine's Day, after which he fled back to his native Hong Kong.",2

1758,29993,"Nevertheless the media spotlight on Hong Kong as a hub for offshore services was not a positive one. What it means in the grand scheme of things is unclear. Anecdotally, fund managers are suggesting the recent stock market slump reflects a general unease in using offshore entities for large investments. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority meanwhile has requested banks to appraise their clients’ exposure to the Mossack Fonseca leaks.",1
1759,29994,"In its bid to convince the rest of the world that Hong Kong’s role in the Panama Papers is nothing more than guilt by association, regulatory pressure will likely fall on some of Hong Kong’s weak spots, with money laundering and its ongoing requirement to meet global standards an obvious target.",1
1760,29995,"Money flows through Hong Kong are increasingly on policy-makers’ radar. As capital poured into China’s booming economy for most of the last 15 years, its monetary authorities could afford to take a lax approach. The situation has now shifted as China faces capital outflow and the senior leadership is acutely focused on anti-corruption efforts. At the same time, China wants to establish the renminbi as an international currency, epitomised by the International Monetary Fund’s recent decision to include the unit in its “special drawing rights” basket. And in this regard, Hong Kong’s status as an alleged money laundering centre does matter.",1
1761,29996,"As a result, the Hong Kong government is acutely sensitive to the issues raised by the Panama Papers. Chan Ka-keung, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, recently defended Hong Kong’s “anti-money laundering’’ credentials within the Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”). Chan noted that politicians and commentators in many developed economies are quick to label countries with low tax rates and more liberal policies as money laundering havens. “This is very wrong’’ he said.",1
1762,29997,"One problem is that Hong Kong is the only FATF member with no system of currency declaration or disclosure at its border. After a 2008 evaluation by FATF inspectors revealed shortcomings in its reporting mechanisms, officials agreed to provide biannual updates on its anti-money laundering and terrorist financing efforts. A progress report was given in 2012, but subsequently deadlines have been allowed to slip. Inspectors were due to make a follow up visit in April 2016 according to a disclosure by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, but that has now been bounced to as far back as July 2018 according to the official FATF calendar with a plenary session to discuss findings slated in February 2019.",1
1763,29998,"Such a delay will likely be welcomed by the SAR government as Hong Kong’s report card has some hits, but a fair few misses since the FATF’s last assessment in 2012. In the plus corner, both the number and variety of court convictions have risen and financial institutions can point to solid results from giving staff more awareness training; 42,555 suspicious transaction reports were made in 2015 compared to 37,188 in 2014. The momentum has been mainlined this year with 13,297 reports made in the first quarter (seeJoint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1
1764,29999,"The number of convictions for money laundering, however, is on a mildly declining trend with 27 in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 122 in 2015, 145 in 2014, 138 in 2013 and 160 in 2012. The value of assets “restrained”, or interceded but not ceased, varies greatly depending on the complexity of the prosecution: in the first quarter of 2016 the figure was a fairly insignificant HK$73.5 million compared to HK$341.5 million in 2015, HK$418.9 million in 2014 and HK$873.4 million in 2013 (seeJoint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1
1765,30000,"Moreover, actually seizing assets on behalf of the government has proven difficult. The authorities had a big win in 2013 when HK$645 million was secured, but this masks a generally weak performance. In the first quarter of 2016 just HK$1.3 million was secured versus HK$55 million in 2015 and HK$23.6 million in 2012 (seeJoint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1
1766,30001,"At the same time the regulatory focus has widened in recent years. With enactment of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance (Cap. 615) (the “AMLO”) in 2012, law enforcers are increasingly targeting frontline gate-keepers.",1
1767,30002,"Shortcomings in customer due diligence have resulted in a number of prosecutions over the past 18 months, with the rate gathering pace.

1768,30003,"In April 2016, for example, a money service operator was convicted at the Eastern Magistrates’ Court for breaching the licensing requirements of the AMLO, resulting in a fine of HK$4,000. In June 2015, a money service operator was sentenced to 200 hours of community service at Fanling Magistrates’ Court after pleading guilty to 12 charges of failing to comply with the customer due diligence and record-keeping. Other prosecutions have resulted in fines, public reprimands and appeared to result from compliance inspections conducted by Customs & Excise officers.",3

1770,30005,"Yeung was granted leave to appeal (HKSAR (applicant) v Yeung Ka Sing, Carson (Respondent), FAMC 28&29 of 2015) in August last year. The fact that Yeung was granted bail pending the outcome has prompted optimism among critics of Hong Kong’s “draconian” money laundering laws that a robust overhaul would ensue.",2
1771,30006,"Yeung was convicted of five charges of dealing with property known or believed to represent the proceeds of an indictable offence, by using five bank accounts to launder HK$721 million between 2 January 2001 and 31 December 2007, contrary to s. 25(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) (“OSCO”).",3
1772,30007,"One of the issues to be dealt with was whether the prosecution must prove that the proceeds (the “property’’) being dealt with in a money laundering charge derives from a criminal act. Heavy criticism has been meted out for the approach taken in Hong Kong. In the UK, the prosecution must prove a predicate offence.",1
1773,30008,"One of the questions posed in Yeung’s appeal is whether Oei Hengky Wiryo v SAR (No. 2) (2007) 10 HKCFAR 98 was wrongly decided on this issue. The mens rea for the offence was also under scrutiny and the operation of the rule against duplicity was also to be considered. If it is felt by the CFA that this is not a safe conviction, it remains to be seen in what kind of shape the ordinance emerges. Should prosecutors have to prove a predicate offence, the bar for a conviction would be set significantly higher.",1
1774,30009,"In theory, one area of progress Hong Kong should be able to report to the FATF is a system for cross-border currency disclosure, after it was labelled as non-compliant back in 2012 due to an inadequate system for disclosing and declaring cross border transactions.",2
1775,30010,"FATF did credit Hong for its April 2012 initiative to adopt a mixed system of declarations for inbound passengers and disclosure for outbound ones, setting the threshold for reporting at HK$120,000. The global watchdog lauded this “fast-track” approach as it expected the legislation to be presented “within 2014.” However, it was not until 2015 that a public consultation was carried out.",1
1776,30011,"Given the challenges posed by Hong Kong’s polarised legislature, the fact that lawmakers baulked at the very idea of a declaration system does not bode well for legislation passing any time soon. Already tourism industry figures have spurned the plans as mainland visitors tend to shop using large sums of cash. Lawmaker Christopher Chung Shu-kun commented last year that HK$120,000 “is not even enough to buy a watch.”",1
1777,30012,"The latest update came in February 2016 when it was stated that the Security Bureau would collate feedback with a view to implementing the system, although no time frame was given. The impression was given of the issue being left in the long grass.",1
1778,30013,"Arguably, it would be easier to focus on Hong Kong’s deep bench of legal and accounting professionals. Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professionals (“DNFBPs”) featured prominently in the 2012 report and in particular the disparity between sanctions the various professions face.",1
1779,30014,"It was noted that DNFBPs were reticent to submit reports. There has been progress on this front – while in 2007 there were just nine suspicious transaction reports (“STRs”) by lawyers, three from accountants and five from trust and company service providers (“TCSPs”), in 2015 the legal sector provided 894. The increase for accountants and TCSPs was less impressive, with the professions providing six and 22 STRs respectively in 2015 (for the 2007 figures, see FATF Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong, China, 19 Oct 2012, p. 33; for the 2015 & 2016 figures, see Joint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1
1780,30015,"Perhaps the most pressing question is what will be the catalyst to shift Hong Kong’s somewhat anomalous approach to cross-border financial reporting. The betting must be that Beijing will increasingly want to regulate such monetary flows both from the perspective of macro-prudential financial stability and anti-corruption initiatives. As the country seeks to become a top-tier financial player it will be pulled toward the adoption of international norms, and so pressure will fall on Hong Kong to become truly FATF compliant.",1

Simple transactions used to launder money should be easy to identify – if the software does not pick it up, then the employees handling the transactions should be able to spot a suspicion. Basic anti-money laundering training would guide someone to tell their AML team if something in a transaction does not look right. What if it did, and the message is still not getting through?",1

A robust regulatory environment, a requirement to train all employees on the risks associated with financial crime and the spectre of a large financial penalty for not doing so have backed banks and other regulated firms into a corner. Gone are the days of leaving all knowledge of money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions busting and bribery to the compliance department. In the present environment, we have to train all employees, management, directors and the C-suite on financial crime risks. And this, as compliance officers know, comes at a great cost to a bank.",1

Although the argument that having an effective compliance programme in place could save you a few million dollars in regulatory fines is quickly gaining ground, compliance officers – it appears – are still bound by tight budgets.

1806,30041,This rings true. The customer facing employees – whether private banking relationship managers or traders creating OTC derivatives – know their client well enough to offer them precisely the right product at the right time. They also should be able to know with the same precision when a deal does not add up. Compliance officers can erroneously believe that ML/TF is not an issue for some of the more sophisticated financial products. Let’s take derivatives as an example. Some compliance officers do not consider AML/CTF something that derivatives traders need to be concerned with and so they did not need training on this area.,1
1807,30042,"This is a huge oversight which could end up costing a financial institution. Mis-priced derivatives contracts can be used as an instrument to launder money and to channel funds to bribe takers. If the traders who engineer these products are able to recognise and report unusual activity – such as a price that does not chime with the market – compliance training is hitting the mark. But if these traders are sitting through a course which spends only a fraction of the time looking at how financial criminals try to manipulate sophisticated products, they might never spot a suspicious transaction. AML/CTF training must reach far beyond the basic stages and into the specific business lines run by banks on the markets. Because this is where the real financial crime takes place.",2

1839,30074,One final point to close off. Carson Yeung was approved by the UK Premier League as a ‘fit and proper person‘ to lead the GBP81.9m (USD129.4m) takeover of Birmingham City in 2009. At this time he was under investigation in Hong Kong and any attempts to perform due diligence should have revealed this.,1
1840,30075,"David Conn’s article in the Guardian from March 2014 highlights some of the key points in the case. This entire story should serve as a reminder to anti-money laundering professionals of how the big game is played. Big money laundering, or the offences to which the law can apply money laundering charges, are not only about petty drug traffickers smurfing a few thousand dollars across a border. It is about major multi-million dollar deals, often carried out in plain view and yet there are no details of how any money was laundered in this case.",1
1841,30076,"Firstly, the old style laundry is still happening, although the garment emporia fronting the operation were all about selling clothes and not cleaning them. Mexican cartels used the clothing stores to store, hide and launder the cash, investigators believe. The businesses in this operation were involved in an old-style laundering typology – the Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE), which is a form of trade based money laundering.",3
1842,30077,"It looks like the drug trafficking capital of the world may have shifted base from Miami to Los Angeles, as police made raids this week on a series of fashion industry businesses and found USD100m in cash.",3
1843,30078,"Lastly, and humourously, it looks like the brains behind this operation was making a tongue in cheek reference to another famous drug related business. In the TV showWeeds, the cartel opened a maternity clothes shop on the California side of the border, dug a tunnel underneath it across to the Mexican side through which it transported drugs north and money south. In the LA ‘Fashion Police‘ operation, one of the shops used to front the laundry was a maternity store.",3

1845,30080,"On 19 September 2014, Wu Wing Kit (Wu), a solicitor and partner of Hong Kong law firm, Fred Kan & Co (FKC), was sentenced to 6 years’ imprisonment for money laundering. This case highlights the importance of solicitors carrying out due diligence in respect of their clients’ identity and the transactions instructed to be carried out, in particular, the source of any funds that are to pass through or be held in the solicitor’s bank accounts, and if there are grounds to support a suspicion, solicitors should make a report to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (JFIU).",3
1846,30081,"Wu was convicted under section 25 of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap 455) (OSCO) which provides that “a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person’s proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property.” “Dealing” includes receiving or acquiring, concealing or disguising, disposing or converting property or bringing it into or removing it from Hong Kong.",3
1847,30082,"Jack Chen (Chen) was the executive director and joint chairman of Natural Dairy (NZ) Holdings Limited (Stock Code 462), a company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (Listco). Chen negotiated with May Wang (Wang) for the Listco to acquire some New Zealand companies owned by Wang, which companies were to acquire 22 dairy farms in New Zealand. Under the agreement, Listco would purchase 20% of Wang’s interest in the New Zealand companies for the consideration of NZ$100 million. Wang’s companies received about NZ$25 million from the Listco and then remitted about NZ$13.7 million (equivalent to HK$73.7 million) to Chen’s company. Out of HK$73.7 million, Chen then remitted HK$68.95 million to FKC’s Client Account, which Wu (on Chen’s instructions) subsequently paid to Chen’s wife. Chen was subsequently alleged to have accepted an advantage from Wang for procuring Listco to acquire Wang’s companies in New Zealand. Both Wu and Chen’s wife were charged with money laundering.",1
1848,30083,"On Wu’s own testimony, he said that Chen told him that there was an agreement to purchase Chen’s wife's entitlement to receive the proceeds under another agreement (which agreement Wu had knowledge of) by an investor behind Chen. Chen wanted Wu to represent the investor. Wu responded that he could not as there was a potential conflict of interests. Chen asked Wu whether the money could go through FKC’s Client Account to Chen’s wife because the investor wanted a solicitors’ firm to witness the money actually received by Chen’s wife the following day. Chen added that it was a bit urgent and asked Wu to do him the favour. Wu agreed to help Chen.",1
1849,30084,"Wu could have reckoned at once, by his knowledge of the value of another agreement, that a preliminary payment of HK$68.95 million at such a short notice would be an unusually large proportion of the purchase price and it would be unusual for such a preliminary payment to be paid before the parties had decided on the terms of the agreement; and",1
1850,30085,Wu’s role in agreeing to transfer the money to Chen’s wife was reduced to a bank account holder who let someone use the bank account and Wu did not tell Chen that the bank record would itself be solid evidence of the payment to Chen’s wife without involvement of a solicitor.,1
1851,30086,"Practice Direction P provides general guidance to solicitors about anti-money laundering. It also contains certain mandatory requirements for law firms to make reasonable efforts to identify and (in certain circumstances) verify the true identity of all clients requesting their services and to apply the appropriate level of due diligence (as prescribed in the Practice Direction) in cases where they act in respect of certain activities such as, for example, financial transactions and other transactions involving custody of funds by the law firm as stakeholder or escrow agent or transfers of funds through their bank accounts.",1
1852,30087,"If Wu clearly and deliberately breached Practice Direction P when dealing with the HK$68.95 million, the court would apply the legal principles pertaining to the offence of money laundering to consider the charge against him.",2
1853,30088,"While the Court said that compliance with Practice Direction P would have saved Wu, the focus should not be so much on Practice Direction P, which does not have the force of law, but rather on s.25 of OSCO. The point to address is whether the person, when dealing with the property, knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that the property represents proceeds of an indictable offence. If Wu had followed Practice Direction P diligently, he may have realised that the situation was one that required him to comply with the reporting requirement under s.25A of OSCO, i.e. send a report to the JFIU and thereby obtain immunity under s.25A of OSCO from the offence under s.25 of OSCO.",1
1854,30089,"Indeed, compliance with Practice Direction P may not have saved Wu if, having done the required due diligence, he still failed to conclude that the transaction was suspicious and make a report. The test is what a reasonable, right thinking member of the community would have thought, not whether Wu followed the Law Society's Practice Direction.",1
1855,30090,"At any time before and after he dealt with the money, Wu had never attempted to obtain any information on the nature and intended purpose of the transaction and source of the funding and there was no apparent reason why he did not make those enquiries.",1
1856,30091,"Wu knew that the amount was unusually large in his professional practice and that Chen’s instruction was unusual, as the money was destined to go from the husband’s company’s bank account to the wife’s account the following day through FKC.",1
1857,30092,Wu knew that Practice Direction P expected a solicitor in his situation of dealing with client’s or potential client’s money to make enquiries to obtain information on the nature and intended purpose of the transaction and source of the funding.,1
1858,30093,"In sentencing Wu to six years’ imprisonment, the Court took into account that Wu had over 20 years’ legal practice, specialising in commercial matters, meaning that he had adequate experience and reasonable grounds to believe that the money in question constituted the proceeds of crime. The Court reduced the starting point of six and half year’s imprisonment by six months, after taking into account Wu’s participation in charitable work and his role of family breadwinner.",2
1859,30094,"This case highlights the importance of solicitors carrying out due diligence in respect of their clients’ identity and the transactions instructed to be carried out, in particular, the source of any funds that are to pass through or be held in the solicitor’s bank accounts.",1
1860,30095,"Section 25 of OSCO will be applicable not only when the launderer deals with the proceeds when he knows the money to be proceeds of an indictable offence but also when he has reasonable grounds to believe it to be so. What a person genuinely believed does not establish “having reasonable grounds to believe” or not. The Court will decide “having reasonable grounds to believe” in an objective manner by establishing what information a person had and whether a right-thinking, common sense member of the community ought to have reasonable grounds to believe that the property represented proceeds of an indictable offence (HKSAR v Pang Hung Fai [2013] 4 HKC 366). This is a case where the Court took the view that there were sufficient red flags which, when viewed objectively, would have led a right-thinking, common sense person to have reasonable grounds to believe that the money constituted proceeds of an indictable offence.",1
1861,30096,"Practitioners should pay attention to any red flags and make inquiries to obtain information on the nature and intended purpose of the transaction and the source of funding in compliance with Practice Direction P, especially when the amount is substantial in nature and the money is passing through the solicitors’ firms’ client account between related parties within a short period of time. Practitioners should constantly assess any matters which may raise suspicions and consider making a report to the JFIU in order to obtain immunity afforded by OSCO.",1
1862,30097,"According to the lawyer’s own testimony, he was told by the client that the transfer was urgent and the client asked him to do him a favour and the lawyer agreed to help him. Urgency is not a valid defence. Doing a favour to a client may attract serious consequences. This case is a serious reminder to busy practitioners not to overlook their professional obligations in dealing with urgent requests by clients, especially when it relates to the handling of money or other property.",1
1863,30098,"In any event, the reporting obligation under s.25A of OSCO accommodates the filing of reports after dealing with the property if the person making the report does so as soon as it is reasonable for him/her to make it and on his/her own initiative.",1

2250,30485,"it might have helped Iconoclast if you had more clearly pointed out the list of properties is actually the list of properties seized by the crown. That is what the underlying link says. It is not a list of properties they now have. I'm not at all sure what Kate is trying to imply, but her approach with that one is very reminiscent of the odious Whaleoil.",1
2251,30486,"Oh, and what I'm saying is - this whole line of spin that National have been running like mad (both themselves and their 'friends') is that Chinese buyers really don't figure at all in relation to the inflation of agri land and Auckland residential house prices. Whereas the point everyone else has been making is that they likely do - and now we're finding that some of that money flooding in here might well be of dubious origin as well.",1
2252,30487,"What I comprehend Kate is that there is very little distinction between Whaleoil an Hager. Both engage in attack politics, using smear and innuendo on behalf of their feeders. What concerned me was that following some serious posts, you too, veered into the same territory, with a smeary inuendo about campaign contributions.",1
2253,30488,"For the record, for your comprehension and there is a record on this site, I consistently advocate land ownership is for citizens only. In this post itself I suggest that National are not recognising the mood of their own supporters on the topic.",1
2254,30489,"oh, I think there is a fairly big difference between Whaleoil and Hager. Back in the early days of this there was a piece by a former undercover police officer whose job had been to infiltrate various left wing New Zealand organisations and report on what they were doing. His cover had been blown by research from Hager, and as he put it (and this is someone whose life had been much more miserable when people knew he had been spying on them, so has no love for Hager) when Hager told him he had evidence he was a cop he knew his cover was completely destroyed because Hager has a ridiculous meticulous eye for detail and dogged desire to persue the truth, so there was no point in trying to bluff his way out.",1
2255,30490,I don't think anyone has held up Whaleoil as an example of accuracy in detail and truth.,1
2256,30491,No one criticised his accuracy in his involvement with last years investigation into money laundering and tax havenshttp://www.icij.org/offshore,1
2257,30492,"Though some people in the latest book were most irate at the revelations in that investigation (though they don't seem to think he was wrong, just irate at the schemes becoming public).",1
2258,30493,"For the record, for what I know about Hager personally I don't have any reason to believe I would like him nor would I want to spend time finding that out. But I will acknowledge his deserved international reputation as a tenacious accurate investigator.",1
2259,30494,"That is rubbish. They are chalk and cheese, chasms apart. Hager's work seems to be based on documented facts, whaleoil's ramblings not, to the point of fantasy and look to see him in court. At the opposite end if Hager's work wasnt substantially truthful I'd suggest he'd be in court for libel with this and his previous works, hasnt happened.",1
2260,30495,regards,1
2261,30496,Explain to me why then that Hagers book is published two months before the election. You might say it accidental but you know it isn't. It's attack politics. Which puts Hagar into the same catagory as Whaleoil. Both have been learning off those weirdy USA right wing nutcases.,1
2262,30497,Both characters also have 'feeders' with an agenda. Hager says so himself. Don't be led by the KDC red herring.,1
2263,30498,"Funny thing is that while it certainly derailed Nationals agenda for a week, it also completely destroyed Labours plan to focus on positive.",1
2264,30499,"Hager definitely wanted the book out before the election. It is not accidental. But it is not actually ""only attack politics"" to reveal people undertaking actions that cross the line from distasteful into criminal. And that is certainly worth knowing before voting for people. The cynic in me suspects that if National wins, after the election Key will say ""we were tried in the court of public opinion and have the publics support, so I don't need to do anything about the allegations raised against Collins (and others) in the book, as we have a mandate with the book in the public arena"".",1
2265,30500,"And Hager doesn't particular like Labour either, so it is not really a ""funny thing"" that it didn't help Labour. His book about Helen Clark's government is estimated to have knocked 2-3% off party support that election.",1
2266,30501,There is still serious evidence of wrongdoing in the public domain. Something that our PM is refusing to remedy or even talk about now. Judith Collins (and Jason Eades) should be sacked not declaring herself innocent. John Key should be saying that it is awful that suffering kiwis were called feral or scum and that is not the sort of behaviour he will tolerate as the PM of NZ.,2
2267,30502,Cancel each other out ? Seems to me they both drag us in the same direction.,1
2268,30503,The media have fallen for it (not blaming that on Hager/Slater) where their focus is entirely on political hissy fits. And it's hard to hear any info at all on policy.,1
2269,30504,"My understanding is the assets are frozen, and may not be disposed or dealt with. They are under the control of the Official Assignee. The assets are still registered in their names. But frozen. They are not in the ownership of the crown.",1
2270,30505,(a) The assets referred to were acquired before they sought to buy Crafar Farms,1
2271,30506,(b) The OIO declined their Crafar Farms application,1
2272,30507,"(c) The OIO found them to be ""not fit and proper persons""",1
2273,30508,(d) ICAC (HK) found them to be money-launderers,1
2274,30509,(e) The frozen assets are tied up in that money-laundering,1
2275,30510,"(a) It is possible for ""not fit and proper"" persons to acquire assets in NZ",1
2276,30511,(b) The pre-Crafar assets were acquired with laundered funds,1
2277,30512,(c) It is easy to acquire many NZ (smaller) properties with laundered money,1
2278,30513,(d) The NZ authorities are ineffectual at detecting these activities,1
2279,30514,"As usual Iconoclast you are proving a heavyweight in contrast to some others about these parts, same as Kate. Plenty around here seem to be of the type thatpost simply to hear their own voice, but you are always content rich.",1
2280,30515,"My thoughts exactly, that as long as you fly under the radar with the sorts of things you buy you can indeed buy a lot with ill gotten gains, and I would venture to suggest that the purchase of these assets is actually a part of the laundering process, not the end result of it",1
2281,30516,"John Key will keep smiling as he banks the cheques. They don't care about public opinion. I was talking to someone from just one Wairarapa business that has lost $30,000 in business per year from James Cameron buying farmland. People are starting to talk about it.",1
2282,30517,"The leaks and smear campaigns must still be going on via the blogs, and directly into mainstream news as well.",1
2283,30518,"If someone setup a quality, edited, filtered news media site seeking objective truth now they would almost have a monopoly in that market space!",1
2284,30519,"Anyway, well done to interest.co.nz for allowing reasonable freedom of expression, running clear transparent articles even while being industry views, while keeping a civil blog.",1
2285,30520,"And you haven't noticed how right wing TVNZ have got over the last few years, Paul Henry, Mike Hosking, both very close to the National party, both have had prime time spots to voice their opinions on, something Hosking does at every opportunity.",1
2286,30521,"At least Henry is pretty funny, Hosking is just a prize dropkick who wants to be funny.",1
2287,30522,Main stream media has been in the pocket of big business the last few years.,1
2288,30523,"National is run by whichever tax dodging big business pays them the most, never has there been such a blatently mercenary political party in NZ.",1
2289,30524,"What Kiwis actually want is the last thing on their mind, luckily for National, some people actually think they care about what they want.",1
2290,30525,whale oil has been (despite KDC assertions) the #1 blog in nz for over 2 years.,1
2291,30526,Do try and keep up..,1
2292,30527,Why would the press read it i wonder?,1
2293,30528,Some of them shamelessly copy his articles and pass them off as their own..,1
2294,30529,"Speaking as someone who knows how to analyse data, I would call whaleoil's traffic figures ""an usual pattern for human visitors being the source of his remarkable visitor numbers""- the thing is anyone who wants to can track down the recent ""where have people been visiting the site from"" reports from the monitoring company and do their own analysis.",1

2567,30802,"Yeung was the chairman of Hong Kong First Division outfit Hong Kong Rangers from 2005 to 2006.[2] In 2005, he made an £80,000 donation to the local football association after buying shirts worn by famous English footballers at auction.[8]",1
2568,30803,"In 2007, he unsuccessfully attempted to take over Birmingham City.[9] Yeung failed to deliver the money for the takeover by the deadline of 30 November 2007 and as a result the takeover bid fell through, he was held responsible for the club's U-turn on the contract offered to manager Steve Bruce in May 2007, which led to Bruce's decision to resign from the club and move to Wigan Athletic F.C. of November that year.[10]",1
2569,30804,"On 21 August 2009, it was reported that Grandtop had made an offer of £81.51 million for Birmingham City Football Club.[12]The Standard reported on 25 August 2009 that Yeung had offered £57 million (HK$729 million) to buy newly promoted Birmingham City, and had reportedly promised the club's manager Alex McLeish £50 million to buy new players, his Hong Kong-listed Grandtop International already had a 29.9 percent stake in the club.

In November 2007 he was looking to sell off residential and commercial developments to Golden Resorts Group (黃金集團) but had difficulties in selling them.[16] In addition, Beijing was stepping up measures to cool off the mainland property market, which affected his revenue streams.[6][16] Similar issues occurred in 2011 when he tried to sell plots of land in Liaoning,[16] he ran into debt in a number of sectors owing millions to HSBC, and many others. He had to borrow large amounts of money and put his luxury home up for sale at Mid-levels.[16] On 4 June 2012, the High Court ordered Carson Yeung Ka-sing to vacate and hand over a HK$300 million mansion on Barker Road to Wing Hang Bank within 56 days after he failed to repay a loan of HK$50 million.[17]",1
2571,30806,"On 29 June 2011, Yeung was arrested at his home in Hong Kong in connection with alleged money laundering.[18] Police officers also swooped on the offices of Birmingham International, and left with an assortment of documents. A brief statement mentioned that Narcotics Bureau officers searched two locations – one on Hong Kong Island and the other in Kowloon – and seized documents; the charges involved five counts of dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of an indictable offence.[19] His hearing was adjourned until 11 August 2011, and was remanded on bail of HK$7 million (US$900,000).",3

2574,30809,"The Yale romanization of Mandarin is a system for transcribing the sounds of Standard Chinese, based on Mandarin Chinese varieties spoken in and around Beijing. It was devised in 1943 by the Yale sinologistGeorge Kennedy for a course teaching Chinese to American soldiers, popularized by continued development of that course at Yale; the system approximated Chinese sounds using English spelling conventions in order to accelerate acquisition of pronunciation by English speakers. The Yale romanization was used in Western textbooks until the late 1970s; the situation was reversed once the relations between the People's Republic of China and the West had improved. Communist China became a member of the United Nations in 1971 by replacing Nationalist China. By 1979, much of the world adopted pinyin as the standard romanization for Chinese geographical names. In 1982, pinyin became an ISO standard; the tables below show the Yale Mandarin representation of each Chinese sound, together with the corresponding IPA phonetic symbol, equivalent representations in Zhùyīn Fúhào and Hanyu Pinyin.",1
2575,30810,"In Mandarin and affricate consonants are all voiceless, but show a contrast between an aspirated and unaspirated series. A much-criticized feature of the Wade–Giles system was its use of an apostrophe to indicate aspiration, as in the syllable t'a contrasting with the unaspirated ta; the corresponding Yale spellings, ta and da suggest an approximation of the aspiration distinction to speakers of English, in which voiceless consonants like t are pronounced with distinct aspiration when they occur at the start of a word, but voiced ones like d are pronounced unaspirated and with weakened voicing in that position. Similar conventions were used in the earlier Gwoyeu Romatzyh system and the pinyin system; the Yale system, like Wade-Giles and Gwoyeu Romatzyh, represents palatal consonants using letters for similar sounds with which they are in complementary distribution. This is more intuitive for English speakers than the pinyin usage of the letters q and x wherein they no longer carry their expected values.",1
2576,30811,"For example, q in pinyin is pronounced something like the ch in chicken and is written as ch in Yale Romanization. Xi in pinyin is pronounced something like English she. Syllables with syllabic fricatives are spelled jr, shr, r, dz, tsz, sz, suggesting approximate pronunciations to English speakers. In pinyin, these are all spelled -i. For example, ""knowledge"" is spelled chih-shih in Wade–Giles and zhishi in pinyin, but in Yale romanization it is written jr-shr—only the last will elicit a near-correct pronunciation from an unprepared English speaker. Tone was marked using diacritics whose shape suggested the corresponding pitch contour: ā, á, ǎ and à; the same method was adopted by pinyin.

2577,30812,"Chongqingromanized as Chungking, is a major city in southwest China. Administratively, it is one of China's four municipalities under the direct administration of central government, the only such municipality in China located far away from the coast. Chongqing was a municipality during the Republic of China administration, serving as its wartime capital during the Second Sino-Japanese War; the current municipality was recreated on 14 March 1997 to help develop the central and western parts of China. The Chongqing administrative municipality has a population of over 30 million, spread over an area the size of Austria; the city of Chongqing made of 9 urban districts has a much smaller population of 8,518,000 as of 2016 estimation. According to the 2010 census, Chongqing is the most populous Chinese municipality, the largest direct-controlled municipality in China, containing 26 districts, eight counties, four autonomous counties; the official abbreviation of the city, ""Yu"", was approved by the State Council on 18 April 1997.",1
2578,30813,"This abbreviation is derived from the old name of a part of the Jialing River that runs through Chongqing and feeds into the Yangtze River. Chongqing has culture. Being one of China's National Central Cities, it serves as the economic centre of the upstream Yangtze basin, it is a major manufacturing transportation hub. Tradition associates Chongqing with the State of Ba; this new capital was first named Jiangzhou. Jiangzhou subsequently remained under Qin Shi Huang's rule during the Qin dynasty, the successor of the Qin State, under the control of Han dynasty emperors. Jiangzhou was subsequently renamed during the Northern and Southern dynasties to Chu Prefecture in 581 AD to Yu Prefecture, in 1102 during Northern Song to Gong Prefecture; the name Yu however survives to this day as an abbreviation for Chongqing, the city centre where the old town stood is called Yuzhong. It received its current name in 1189, after Prince Zhao Dun of the Southern Song dynasty described his crowning as king and Emperor Guangzong as a ""double celebration"".",1
2579,30814,"In his honour, Yu Prefecture was therefore renamed Chongqing subprefecture marking the occasion of his enthronement. In 1362, Ming Yuzhen, a peasant rebel leader, established the Daxia Kingdom at Chongqing for a short time. In 1621, another short-lived kingdom of Daliang was established by She Chongming with Chongqing as its capital. In 1644, after the fall of the Ming dynasty to a rebel army, together with the rest of Sichuan, was captured by Zhang Xianzhong, said to have massacred a large number of people in Sichuan and depopulated the province, in part by causing many people to flee to safety elsewhere; the Manchus conquered the province, during the Qing dynasty, immigration to Chongqing and Sichuan took place with the support of the Qing emperor. In 1890, the British Consulate General was opened in Chongqing; the following year, the city became the first inland commerce port open to foreigners. The French, German, US and Japanese consulates were opened in Chongqing in 1896–1904. During and after the Second Sino-Japanese War, from Nov 1937 to May 1946, it was Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's provisional capital.",1
2580,30815,"After Britain, the United States, other Allies entered the war in Asia in December 1941, one of the Allies' deputy commanders of operations in South East Asia, Joseph Stilwell, was based in the city. The city was visited by Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander of SEAC, itself headquartered in Ceylon, modern day Sri Lanka. Chiang Kai Shek as Supreme Commander in China worked with Stilwell; the Japanese Air Force bombed it. Due to its mountainous environment, many people were saved from the bombing. Due to the bravery and sacrifices made by the local people during World War II, Chongqing became known as the City of Heroes. Many factories and universities were relocated from eastern China to Chongqing during the war, transforming this city from inland port to a industrialized city. In late November 1949 the Nationalist KMT government fled the city. On 14 March 1997, the Eighth National People's Congress decided to merge the Sub-provincial city with the neighbouring Fuling and Qianjiang prefectures that it had governed on behalf of the province since September 1996.",1

2582,30817,"The Asian financial crisis was a period of financial crisis that gripped much of East and Southeast Asia beginning in July 1997 and raised fears of a worldwide economic meltdown due to financial contagion. The crisis started in Thailand with the financial collapse of the Thai baht after the Thai government was forced to float the baht due to lack of foreign currency to support its currency peg to the U. S. dollar. At the time, Thailand had acquired a burden of foreign debt that made the country bankrupt before the collapse of its currency; as the crisis spread, most of Southeast Asia and Japan saw slumping currencies, devalued stock markets and other asset prices, a precipitous rise in private debt.

After 30 years in power, Indonesian PresidentSuharto was forced to step down on 21 May 1998 in the wake of widespread rioting that followed sharp price increases caused by a drastic devaluation of the rupiah; the effects of the crisis lingered through 1998.

2584,30819,"Only Singapore and Taiwan proved insulated from the shock, but both suffered serious hits in passing, the former due to its size and geographical location between Malaysia and Indonesia. By 1999, analysts saw signs that the economies of Asia were beginning to recover. After the crisis, economies in the region worked toward financial stability and better financial supervision; until 1999, Asia attracted half of the total capital inflow into developing countries. The economies of Southeast Asia in particular maintained high interest rates attractive to foreign investors looking for a high rate of return; as a result, the region's economies received a large inflow of money and experienced a dramatic run-up in asset prices. At the same time, the regional economies of Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea experienced high growth rates, of 8–12% GDP, in the late 1980s and early 1990s; this achievement was acclaimed by financial institutions including IMF and World Bank, was known as part of the ""Asian economic miracle"".",1
2585,30820,"The cause of the debacle are many and disputed. Thailand's economy developed into an economic bubble fueled by hot money. More and more was required as the size of the bubble grew; the same type of situation happened in Malaysia and Indonesia, which had the added complication of what was called ""crony capitalism"". The short-term capital flow was expensive and highly conditioned for quick profit. Development money went in a uncontrolled manner to certain people only - not the best suited or most efficient, but those closest to the centers of power. In the mid-1990s, Thailand and South Korea had large private current account deficits, the maintenance of fixed exchange rates encouraged external borrowing and led to excessive exposure to foreign exchange risk in both the financial and corporate sectors. In the mid-1990s, a series of external shocks began to change the economic environment; the devaluation of the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese yen due to the Plaza Accord of 1985, the raising of U.

This made the United States a more attractive investment destination relative to Southeast Asia, attracting hot money flows through high short-term interest rates, raised the value of the U.

At the same time, Southeast Asia's export growth slowed in the spring of 1996, deteriorating their current account position; some economists have advanced the growing exports of China as a factor contributing to ASEAN nations' export growth slowdown, though these economists maintain the main cause of their crises was excessive real estate speculation.",1

Unlike other public broadcasters like the BBC and NHK, which are funded by licence fees, RTHK is directly supported by an annual government funding; the Hong Kong Government launched its first radio broadcasting station, known as ""GOW"", on 30th June 1928, with a starting staff of only six people. Several name changes occurred over the next few years, it became known as ""Radio Hong Kong"" in 1948. In 1949, broadcasting operations were taken over by the Government Information Services, but by 1954, RHK had managed to establish itself as an independent department.",1
2591,30826,"Up until 1966, the radio station was only on-air for three periods during the day. This was due to many of the presenters being part-time freelancers who had to fit their radio appearances in with their normal daily working schedule. In 1969, the station's medium wave AM transmitting station was moved from a waterfront site in Hung Hom to the summit of Golden Hill in the New Territories. Although the new transmitters were much more powerful, the mountain-top site proved unsuitable for medium wave transmissions and reception in some areas has remained problematic since. In March 1969, RHK moved its headquarters to new purpose-built studios located at Broadcasting House in Kowloon Tong. A Public Affairs Television Unit was established in 1970 to produce TV programmes for required broadcast by independent channels. At that time, RTHK did not have its own television broadcast transmitters. In 1973, RTHK set up its own radio newsroom. Prior to this, all news had been prepared by Government Information Services staff.",1

This arrangement became impractical following the move to the new studios in 1969, so a GIS newsroom was set up in Broadcasting House; this arrangement proved unsatisfactory and RTHK's own journalists, who until had been confined to producing magazine programmes, took over the entire news operation. In 1976, the station's name was changed to ""Radio Television Hong Kong"" to reflect its new involvement in television programme production. In the same year, it began to produce educational television programmes for schools after absorbing the independent Educational Television Unit. In 1986, RTHK headquarters moved across the road to the former Commercial Television studios, which were renamed Television House; the station's first News and Financial News channel, Radio 7, was established in November 1989.",1

In 2013, RTHK launched a new television channel. To support this new television operation, the government administration increased the station's funding by between HK$300 million and HK$400 million a year. In April 2016, RTHK took over the analog channel frequencies of Asia Television after the latter's free television license expired. In March 2017, as the Hong Kong government decided to terminate DAB services in Hong Kong, RTHK said that it would integrate the existing DAB programmes into existing AM and FM radio channels; as the government claimed that RTHK should stop DAB service within six months, that means DAB service will be terminated no than September 30, 2017.",1

It was published by revised several times; the International Organization for Standardization adopted pinyin as an international standard in 1982, was followed by the United Nations in 1986. The system was adopted as the official standard in Taiwan in 2009, where it is used for international events rather than for educational or computer-input purposes, but ""some cities and organizations, notably in the south of Taiwan, did not accept this"", so it remains one of several rival romanization systems in use.",1

In 1605, the JesuitmissionaryMatteo Ricci published Xizi Qiji in Beijing; this was the first book to use the Roman alphabet to write the Chinese language. Twenty years another Jesuit in China, Nicolas Trigault, issued his Xi Ru Ermu Zi at Hangzhou. Neither book had much immediate impact on the way in which Chinese thought about their writing system, the romanizations they described were intended more for Westerners than for the Chinese. One of the earliest Chinese thinkers to relate Western alphabets to Chinese was late Ming to early Qing dynasty scholar-official, Fang Yizhi; the first late Qing reformer to propose that China adopt a system of spelling was Song Shu. A student of the great scholars Yu Yue and Zhang Taiyan, Song had been to Japan and observed the stunning effect of the kanasyllabaries and Western learning there; this galvanized him into activity on a number of fronts, one of the most important being reform of the script.",1

The Wade–Giles system was produced by Thomas Wade in 1859, further improved by Herbert Giles in the Chinese–English Dictionary of 1892, it was popular and used in English-language publications outside China until 1979. In the early 1930s, Communist Party of China leaders trained in Moscow introduced a phonetic alphabet using Roman letters, developed in the Soviet Oriental Institute of Leningrad and was intended to improve literacy in the Russian Far East; this Sin Wenz or ""New Writing"" was much more linguistically sophisticated than earlier alphabets, but with the major exception that it did not indicate tones of Chinese. In 1940, several thousand members attended a Border Region Sin Wenz Society convention.

Over thirty journals soon appeared written in Sin Wenz, plus large numbers of translations, some contemporary Chinese literature, a spectrum of textbooks. In 1940, the movement reached an apex when Mao's Border Region Government declared that the Sin Wenz had the same legal status as traditional characters in government and public documents. Many educators and political leaders looked forward to the day when they would be universally accepted and replace Chinese characters. Opposition arose, because the system was less well adapted to writing regional languages, therefore would require learning Mandarin. Sin Wenz fell into relative disuse during the following years. In 1943, the U. S. military engaged Yale University to develop a romanization of Mandarin Chinese for its pilots flying over China.

Third, I espouse what I view to be two of Locke’s most contentious premises, namely his supposition of the appropriative power of labour, and his formulation of the sufficiency and spoilage provisos. Additionally, I consider whether Locke can adequately defend these premises against criticisms.

This article challenges this orthodox view with a critical analysis of the preponderant formulations of the foremost tenet of jus ad bellum: just cause. In response to the theoretical inadequacies of these formulations—that is, their failure to distinguish between aggressing parties and mere accomplices to aggression—I develop a novel formulation of the just cause proviso, predicated on the presence of what I term as “manifest aggression.” Through this lens, I show that the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan was, in actuality, an ethically indefensible military venture.",1

Second, I outline his argument for private property and the provisos (limits) he sets upon that right.

2682,26172,Question 1,1
2683,26173,What is the main purpose of Expert Systems?,1
2684,26174,Answer: The main purpose of ES is to replicate knowledge and skills of,1
2685,26175,"human experts in a particular area, and then to use this knowledge to solve",1
2686,26176,similar problems without human experts participation (computationally).,1

2688,26178,What is the main diﬀerence between conventional computer programs and,1
2689,26179,production systems (rule–based systems)?,1
2690,26180,Answer: Conventional programs use pre–programmed algorithms usually,1
2691,26181,"with many control ﬂow statements (loops, iterations) that clearly deﬁne",1
2692,26182,the order in which the components of a program should work. Production,1

I was instantly hooked and was delighted to discover there was still an endless backlog of Hong Kong delirium left to discover. Using Thomas Weisser’s book Asian Trash Cinema as a roadmap I set out to see as many HK films as possible.

2795,26285,"The aim of this paper is to analyse the impact of transformational leadership and employee commitment on organizational citizenship behavior. For this purpose past researches were analysed and questionnaires were distributed in different sectors of Pakistan. 100 questionnaires were distributed in administrative staff, faculty members, employees and managers. 80 complete questionnaires were received at response rate of 80%. After preparing a detailed literature review, a non-probability random sampling technique was used to select the sample. Pearson's moment quotient and linear regression was applied to study the relationship between transformational leadership, employee commitment and organizational citizenship behavior. This study will help managers and employees how transformational leadership and employee commitment enhances the organizational citizenship behavior. 1. INTRODUCTION: Organizations worldwide are trying to enhance organizational citizenship behaviors. Organizational citizenship behavior is an informal workplace behavior that goes above the part of duty. Different factors have impact on organizational citizenship behavior. Transformational leadership has strong impact on extra-role behaviors that goes beyond the specified role requirements and directed towards individuals, organizational members or groups as unit and assists them with their work tasks and responsibilities in order to promote organizational goals [1]. Transformational leadership is responsible for changing the workplace behavior of the employees [2]. Under the supervision of transformational leaders' individuals, organizational members or groups feel more loyalty and trust [3], which increase the satisfaction level of the employees [4], and respect towards leaders and are motivated to participate in extra-role behaviors. Transformational leaders have been shown to enhance individuals and organizational members trust satisfaction and organizational citizenship behavior. It is also found that person who has strong personality set their goals and objectives themselves and can easily distinct them from others on the basis of their capabilities [5]. The transformational leadership motivates the organizational employees that they give the priority to the large organizational interest over individual interest. Transformational leadership is consistently related to individual's organizational citizenship behaviors [6]. Employee commitment is another factor that has impact on organizational citizenship behavior. Affective organizational commitment is referred as antecedent of employee commitment [7]. The employee commitment consists of three component model [8], and finds that this model is very necessary for the awareness and achieving the desired goal of the firm. The employee commitment has a potential to construct a win-win situation for both of the parties [9]. When organizational members have strong belief that their membership in organization must be maintained and the goals and objectives are widely shared then it'll create effective commitment in the employees and they become more loyal and will more participate in organizational citizenship behaviors. Employees with strong affective organizational commitment are more valuable employees to the organization. When organization links the rewards with individual's performance then it'll create an emotional link with the organizational interest. So may get benefit through a reduced turnover but their productivity increases and it results in higher job satisfaction, higher self-actualization, and high participation in organizational citizenship behaviors. Organizational citizenship behavior can be extremely important in the organizations and can contribute to competitive advantage. organizational citizenship behavior includes such a type of behavior of employees which create the positive impact in the organization performance [10] and the employee have higher job satisfaction level because normally it is observed that there is positive relationship between OCB and Job satisfaction level [11]. Organizational citizenship behavior is considered relatively new concept in organizational behaviors so that in Pakistan there has been given less importance to organizational citizenship behaviors. An effective leadership program can be of greater importance to help and build leadership qualities among individuals within the organization [12]. But in Pakistan less importance is given to leadership development. The managers in Pakistan do not feel much responsibility to assist and motivates the employees in their tasks and duties then employees cannot enhance their abilities properly and less participates in organization citizenship behaviors. In Pakistan most of the organizations don't link rewards with individual's performance so employees feels less committed to the organization and will less participate in extra-role behaviors. 2.

3191,26681,"Section 25(1) of the OSCO Wu was charged under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) (“OSCO”). Section 25(1) provides that “a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person’s proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property.”",1
3192,26682,"Guilty Act The necessary guilty act under section 25(1) of the OSCO is “dealing”. Under section 2(1) of the OSCO, “dealing” includes various acts such as receiving or acquiring the property, concealing or disguising the property, as well as disposing of or converting the property. The prosecution is not required to prove the crime leading to the proceeds,[2] to specify the crime leading to the proceeds,[3] nor to prove that the property is the proceeds of the crime.[4]",1
3193,26683,"Guilty Intention Regarding the guilty intention, the offence requires proof of knowledge or having reasonable grounds to believe. The defendant would be convicted if (i) objectively “reasonable grounds” existed for the “belief” that the property handled by the Defendant represented the proceeds of a serious crime, and (ii) subjectively he was aware of those reasonable grounds.[5]",1
3194,26684,"Background Jack Chen (“Chen”) was the executive director and joint chairman of Natural Dairy (NZ) Holdings Limited, a company listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (“Listco”). In or around 2008, the Listco, through Chen, negotiated a deal with May Wang (“Wang”) for the acquisition of a company indirectly owned by Wang in New Zealand, i.e. UBNZ Assets Holdings Limited (“UBAH”). Under the deal, the Listco would pay NZ$100,000,000 for the purchase of 20% shareholding of UBAH, with an option to purchase the remaining 80% at NZ$400,000,000. The Listco would also provide financial assistance to UBAH.",1
3195,26685,"It later transpired that part of the proceeds of sale in relation to the acquisition of UBAH and/or financial assistance to UBAH (approximately HK$73.7m) was remitted into Goldmate Securities (USA) Limited (“Goldmate”), a company in which Chen was the majority shareholder and director. Chen and Wang were subsequently charged with 1 count of conspiracy to offer advantage to an agent and 1 count of money-laundering. It was alleged that Chen accepted, among other things, the HK$73.7 million above from Wang as reward for procuring the Listco to acquire UBAH.",3
3196,26686,"Prosecution’s Case against Wu The evidence prosecution brought forward showed that after Goldmate received the HK$73.7 million, Chen caused Goldmate to transfer HK$68.95 million into the client account of Wu’s law firm, Fred Kan & Co (“FKC’s Client Account”). Acting on Chen’s instructions, Wu transferred the money to Ye Fang (“Ye”), Chen’s wife and the 2nd defendant in this case. Wu was the solicitor for Wang and Chen at the crucial junctures.",3
3197,26687,"Against the above background, the prosecution’s stance against Wu was that when Wu dealt with the money of HK$68.95m, he had the knowledge that it, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly represented proceeds of an indictable offence, or alternatively, he had reasonable grounds to believe that the money was of this nature. The prosecution relied on the following highlighted evidence to prove Wu’s knowledge or belief:-",3
3198,26688,4. Part A of Practice Direction P issued by the Law Society of Hong Kong required a solicitor to: (i) obtain information on the nature and intended purpose of the transaction; and (iii) obtain information on the source of funding.,1
3199,26689,"Wu’s Defence Wu denied knowledge or belief in any money-laundering transactions. Wu was informed that a deposit of HK$68.95 million was “in the process of coming into” FKC’s Client Account from Chen, so Wu contacted Chen. Chen told Wu over the phone that there was an agreement to purchase Ye’s entitlement to receive the proceeds by investor behind Chen. Wu told Chen that he could not represent the investor behind Chen since he found a conflict of interests. Wu asked Chen to take away the money but Chen asked Wu to transfer the money to Ye instead. Chen said the investor wanted a solicitor to witness the transfer of the money to Ye. Therefore, Wu agreed to help Chen.",3
3200,26690,"Verdict and Sentence The Court held that the prosecution had proved all elements of the charge of money-laundering against Wu. In this regard, the Court found, among other things, the following facts against Wu:-",3
3201,26691,1. Wu knew that the amount was unusually huge in his professional practice. He must have recognized immediately that a preliminary payment of HK$68.95 million at such a short notice would be an unusually large proportion of the purchase price. It was also unusual for such a preliminary payment to be paid before the parties had decided on the terms of the agreement;,3
3202,26692,"2. Wu knew that Chen’s instruction was unusual since the money was intended to go from a husband’s company’s bank account to the wife’s account the following day via FKC’s Client Account. Wu knew that the money actually came from Chen’s investor, but Wu did not ask the investor’s identity. Chen said that the investor wanted a solicitor to witness the transfer of the money to Ye. However, Wu did not tell Chen that the bank record would itself be solid evidence of the payment without the involvement of a solicitor; and",3
3203,26693,"3. Wu knew that Practice Direction P expected a solicitor in his situation of dealing with client’s or potential client’s money to make enquiries to obtain information on the nature and intended purpose of the transaction, and the source of funding. However, at any time before or after he dealt with the money, he had never attempted to do so. It was a deliberate choice not to make such enquires. It was not an error of judgment, negligence or inadvertence.",3
3204,26694,"The Court held that Wu, possessed of the above facts, would objectively consider them sufficient to lead a person to believe that the money constituted proceeds of an indictable offence. As a result, Wu was convicted of money-laundering and sentenced to 6 years imprisonment.",3
3205,26695,"Conclusion Professionals deal with client’s money on a day-to-day basis. Very often, client’s money is transferred from one party to another party upon client’s instructions without the professional making further inquiries as to the nature and source of funds and the purpose of transfer. However, as this case shows, professionals “turning a blind eye” in dealing with client’s money may already be sufficient to be convicted of the offence of money-laundering.",1

This person, active in a period marking both post-WWII relief and early-Cold War anxiety, was Maurice Merleau-Ponty: a French phenomenologist who, in his distinctive way, never gave way to absolutist thinking, and who wrote of Cezanne’s doubt in art and then applied it to his own personal politics. Merleau-Ponty developed rethinking as a method, and – while never relinquishing his commitment to social, political, and economic justice — infused his understanding of these fields with the admission that being human is, for better or for worse, a complex undertaking. And that this sometimes involves acknowledging our limits together with our contradictions.",1

3270,26760,"This thesis paper tackles contemporarythemes such as alienation, dreams and self-actualization, and tries to paint a picture of the disillusioned artist in society. In the present capitalist-driven society, the “real” world, also known as the corporate world, is where people compete with each other to try to make ends meet.The corporate world becomes the battleground for survival, where reaching the top of the corporate ladder is tantamount to success. Along with that, we, through different forms of media, are fed with images that serve as standards for beauty, sexuality, and success. Those who veer away from these standards and ideals are looked down upon. As a result, they isolate themselves and try to find their own niche somewhere else.Majority of these deviant members of society are artists.Non-conformists are propelled to seek escape from what reality offers them. In the film, dreams serve as a venue for escapism, allowing the dreamer, Vincent, tobe absorbed with the possibilities unachieved in the waking world. The quest for maximizing one’s potential, achieving success, peace of mind and happiness is acommon goal shared by every member of society. It is doubly arduous for the socially rejected, but never impossible.",1

3275,26765,"Intertextuality, the term defining the relationship and the similarity of a newly-produced text with previous ones, has provided a broad array of subjects to be studied especially in social sciences. Firstly, literary works have been analyzed within the framework of intertextuality, and striking similarities have been found among literary texts. Nevertheless, the world cannot be limited to the literature since there are numerous ways and possibilities for human beings to express themselves. Philosophy, for instance, is the deepest version of humans"" self-expressions and understandings; therefore, it has been inevitably influenced by external sources such as myths, literature, politics, economics or society. Although the intertextuality in philosophy has been mostly analyzed through the written philosophical works, there is a more basic and evident relationship in philosophers"" perspectives: the intertextuality in the philosophy itself. Accordingly, this study aims to illustrate the role of the intertextual references in the formation of philosophical approaches. For this purpose, the study will focus on Albert Camus""s ""absurd"" philosophy, and the intertextual relationship between Camus""s philosophy and the myth of Sisyphus will be examined from a comparative perspective. By this way, it is aimed to demonstrate how our happiness is dependent on our desire to ""imagine Sisyphus happy"".",1

3277,26767,"In this article, I investigate the relationship between freedom and terrorism in Camus by answering such questions as: is terrorism a form of rebellion? What is the criterion used to discern an act of rebellion from a terroristic act? I will answer these questions by investigating the connections amongst homicide, freedom, suicide, values, and beliefs in Camus’ moral philosophy and by referring to Dostoevsky’s thought. I will investigate Camus’ thought by borrowing the philosophical theory of positive and negative freedom by Isaiah Berlin to explain to what kind of notion of freedom terrorism refers to and to what political and philosophical consequences it leads. I will therefore show that terrorism is based on: 1. obedience to abstract ideas; 2. acceptation of negative freedom, which implies the absence of moral restraint; and 3. rejection of positive freedom, based on self-knowledge and self-control. Camus condemns terrorism by stating that it leads to dictatorship and founds his idea of good society on the enhancement of critical thinking as well as on the complementation of the positive and negative freedom that, in order to found a just and democratic society, must exist within the limit represented by human dignity.",1

3373,26863,What Is Design?,1
3374,26864,Explaining the idea/concept of something,1
3375,26865,Usually with graphical diagrams,1
3376,26866,With the intention to build,1

3387,26877,Architectural Design major seeks to integrate engineering and architecture in,1
3388,26878,ways that blend innovative architectural design with cutting-edge engineering,1
3389,26879,technologies.,1
3390,26880,User interface design (UI) or user interface engineering is the design of,1

3410,26900,The design should be traceable to the analysis,1

3425,26915,Component of System,1
3426,26916,System software is the software used to manage and,1
3427,26917,control the hardware components and which allow,1
3428,26918,interaction between the hardware and the other types,1
3429,26919,of software. The most obvious type of system software,1
3430,26920,is the computer's operating system but device,1
3431,26921,drivers are also included within this category. There,1
3432,26922,are three components of system software:,1

3438,26928,Abstraction,1
3439,26929,In software engineering and computer,1
3440,26930,"science, Abstraction is a technique for arranging",1
3441,26931,complexity of computer systems. It works by establishing,1
3442,26932,a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the,1
3443,26933,"system, suppressing the more complex details below the",1
3444,26934,current level. Conceptual abstractions may be formed by,1
3445,26935,filtering the information content of a concept or an,1
3446,26936,"observable phenomenon, selecting only the aspects which",1
3447,26937,are relevant for a particular purpose.,1

3451,26941,Identifying important features for representation,1
3452,26942,There are many levels of abstraction depending,1
3453,26943,on how detailed the representation is required,1
3454,26944,Data abstraction - representation of data objects,1
3455,26945,Procedural abstraction - representation of,1

3458,26948,14,1
3459,26949,Refinement is a generic term of computer science that,1
3460,26950,encompasses various approaches for,1
3461,26951,producing correct computer programs and simplifying,1
3462,26952,existing programs to enable their formal verification.,1
3463,26953,"In formal methods, program refinement is",1
3464,26954,the verifiable transformation of an abstract (high-,1
3465,26955,level) formal specification into a concrete (low-,1
3466,26956,level) executable program.,1
3467,26957,Stepwise refinement allows this process to be done in stages.,1
3468,26958,"Logically, refinement normally involves implication, but",1
3469,26959,there can be additional complications.,1

3473,26963,"In software engineering, modularity refers to the extent to which",1
3474,26964,a software/Web application may be divided into smaller modules.,1
3475,26965,Software modularity indicates that the numbers of applications,1
3476,26966,modules are capable of serving a specified business domain.,1
3477,26967,Modularity is an important Software Engineering principle. It is a,1
3478,26968,"practical application of the principle of “Separation of Concerns"" by",1
3479,26969,dividing a complex system into simpler and more manageable modules.,1
3480,26970,The ubiquitous television set is an example of a system made up of a,1
3481,26971,"number of modules – speakers, projection tube, channel buttons, volume",1
3482,26972,"buttons, etc. Each module has its own defined functionality but when",1
3483,26973,"they are put together synergistically, the complete functionalities of a",1

3489,26979,Software is divided into separately named,1
3490,26980,and addressable modules,1
3491,26981,“Divide and conquer” approach - problem,1
3492,26982,is broken into manageable pieces,1

3494,26984,integrated into the whole system,1
3495,26985,19.,1
3496,26986,19,1
3497,26987,The alternative approach is to take a complete system,1
3498,26988,and decompose it into its modules. This approach is,1
3499,26989,known as the decomposition or top-down approach.,1
3500,26990,"A car, for example, can be decomposed into a number of",1
3501,26991,"sub-systems: body, fuel system, electrical system,",1
3502,26992,"transmission, etc.",1
3503,26993,The electrical system can be further decomposed into,1
3504,26994,"modules such as battery, alternator, lights, etc.",1

3543,27033,A hierarchical control system is a form of control system,1
3544,27034,in which a set of devices and software is arranged in a,1

3622,27112,"While the saga of the takeover by Trillion Trophy Asia rumbles on, BIH’s current major shareholder Carson Yeung faces an uncertain time. His final appeal against his money laundering conviction will be heard on May 31 in the Court of Final Appeal – will he emerge a free man or will he have to return to jail to serve out the remainder of his sentence?",2
3623,27113,"Three years ago yesterday, I attended the district court for the first time along with fellow Blues blogger Matthew Elliott to see the opening of Carson’s trial. It was the first chapter of the time I’ve spent here in Hong Kong and opened my eyes to the chicanery not only of the legal system but the ways of the financial world in Hong Kong.",1
3624,27114,"Next month will see the final chapter for Carson at least. His appeal will be heard simultaneously with that of another convicted money launderer, Iraqi-born Dutch national Salim Majed. The reason for this is that both cases will test the money laundering law as it currently stands with appeals on technical grounds; that of duplicity of offences (whereby the prosecution has bundled many separate transactions into one offence) and of the lack of proof of an underlying offence.",2
3625,27115,I know I’ve certainly been worried in the past that should Carson have his convictions overturned he could return to Birmingham City as there would be no bar against it; I’ve been assured by various sources that his time is now over following the deal cut with EY but I will admit that I want to wait for it to happen before believing it.,2
3626,27116,My co-author Will Giles has always maintained that he believes Carson will walk free from his final appeal. Having sat through much of the original trial I can understand why; the case against Carson appeared to be that he had a lot of money go through his accounts and no effort was made for long periods by the prosecution to prove that the money was the product of an indictable offence.,1
3627,27117,"This has changed somewhat with the arrest of alleged triad Cheung Chi Tai, one of the people named as a depositor of cash into the accounts in question. His trial has been delayed somewhat and there is no certainty over what will happen as legal sources here believe that it will be difficult to get people like Carson to testify against Cheung in the case.",2
3628,27118,"On the other side of the coin, senior counsel sources here in Hong Kong have advised me that it’s very unlikely Carson will see his appeal upheld. There is immense political pressure from the mainland to stop corruption and with various figures in China having been convicted of bribery and abuse of power including senior political figures such as Zhou Yongkang (who Will and I link to Carson in the book) it could well be that Carson finds his appeal unsuccessful.",3
3629,27119,It’s eminently possible that Carson will have his appeal partially upheld and his sentence reduced to time served but that would still mean he would not be allowed to be a director of Blues (or BIH while the company owns the football club) under FL regulations. That seems like the compromise agreement; the conviction remains which pleases China while Carson gets to stay out of prison and can continue to invest in the stock market as he has been since his release in August.,3
3630,27120,I really do think we have seen the last of Carson at BCFC; the deal he has cut with BIH will ensure nothing further emerges in court about the way BIH was run with him at the helm which means the former hairdresser can continue some kind of stock-market investing career.,3
3631,27121,I know some people won’t believe it until any and all HK/Chinese influence is removed from the club but the truth is that Carson is just another small fish in what is a shark tank of investors here in Hong Kong.,1
3632,27122,Very interesting Daniel.I think your right- the political weight behind the clean up in China will not leave HK untouched.I think your compromise idea is probably bang on.CY is a small player by HK standards and got in way above his depth.He tried and during his tenure we had a very special day.I wish him no harm but please CY disappear gracefully and let us get on with rebuilding our club. Pannu on the other hand……I think I better keep my thoughts to myself.,1
3633,27123,Very informative article. Would be interesting if the judge decreed that Carson could remain free (on a time served guilty basis) on the proviso that he becomes a witness for the prosecution in the Cheung Chi Tai trial.,1
3634,27124,I suppose one way they could do it is for TTA to buy the shares directly from CY. I wonder if in the agreement CY made with E&Y to stay out of things concerning BIH he also agreed to sell his shares as soon as they are re listed on the HKSE.,1
3635,27125,"I see, tbh I don’t understand the 1st thing about shares apart from the sharesave scheme I did at work!!. I just wondered how it would work as CY is the largest share holder, but if as you say they may discuss it at the EGM to buy them back, which would make sense if they did, then maybe we will then be rid of him for good.",1
3636,27126,"Chris, The workplace share save scheme is a brilliant way it invest some of your hard earned cash and with a 20% discount and 3 or 5 years to save or your money back with interest you can`t go very far wrong mate. my advice is put in as much as you can as you can`t lose mate. and take out new one each year as you can but at todays price with the discount and you get to a stage where the ist investment pays for subsequent years. MY guess would be Carson deal with e&y will include his shares which may need an agreement from s/holders at egm.",1
3637,27127,Good news about carson not being involved with bcfc but I can’t help feeling that good intentions were there when he took over the club and we don’t really know if the money to buy the club was his in the first place I think you got it right Daniel small fish in a big sea but it doesn’t matter how much money people have got the club and its genuine fans will always be bigger than any business person and any amount of money even though we need some right now I’m not interested in what happens to people who leave our club like a lot of people I’m a Birmingham city supporter and will be till the day I die as for pannu get back under the stone that’s where you deserve to be keep up the good work Daniel and kro,1

3644,27134,"Dan a quick question , on the 31STMay -does CY appeal take the form of a full trial lasting days in front of judges or simply that the judges on the day give down a full and final verdict after totally assessing the evidence once again ?

3690,31413,"As the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (“ICIJ”) selectively made public leaked documents relating to more than 200,000 offshore entities held by clients of Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca, it emerged that nearly a third of these clients were found to be in Hong Kong and the PRC.",1
3691,31414,"The revelation should not be a big surprise as at least a third of direct investment into Hong Kong comes from companies principally based in the British Virgin Islands and Bermuda. There are many reasons to use such offshore booking centres – both legitimate and illegitimate – with some entities clearly using them to evade domestic capital controls in China, and others in Hong Kong benefiting from capturing funds within local stock and property markets.",1
3692,31415,"Nevertheless the media spotlight on Hong Kong as a hub for offshore services was not a positive one. What it means in the grand scheme of things is unclear. Anecdotally, fund managers are suggesting the recent stock market slump reflects a general unease in using offshore entities for large investments. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority meanwhile has requested banks to appraise their clients’ exposure to the Mossack Fonseca leaks.",1

3694,31417,"Money flows through Hong Kong are increasingly on policy-makers’ radar. As capital poured into China’s booming economy for most of the last 15 years, its monetary authorities could afford to take a lax approach. The situation has now shifted as China faces capital outflow and the senior leadership is acutely focused on anti-corruption efforts. At the same time, China wants to establish the renminbi as an international currency, epitomised by the International Monetary Fund’s recent decision to include the unit in its “special drawing rights” basket. And in this regard, Hong Kong’s status as an alleged money laundering centre does matter.",1
3695,31418,"As a result, the Hong Kong government is acutely sensitive to the issues raised by the Panama Papers. Chan Ka-keung, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, recently defended Hong Kong’s “anti-money laundering’’ credentials within the Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”). Chan noted that politicians and commentators in many developed economies are quick to label countries with low tax rates and more liberal policies as money laundering havens. “This is very wrong’’ he said.",1

After a 2008 evaluation by FATF inspectors revealed shortcomings in its reporting mechanisms, officials agreed to provide biannual updates on its anti-money laundering and terrorist financing efforts. A progress report was given in 2012, but subsequently deadlines have been allowed to slip. Inspectors were due to make a follow up visit in April 2016 according to a disclosure by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, but that has now been bounced to as far back as July 2018 according to the official FATF calendar with a plenary session to discuss findings slated in February 2019.",1
3697,31420,"Such a delay will likely be welcomed by the SAR government as Hong Kong’s report card has some hits, but a fair few misses since the FATF’s last assessment in 2012. In the plus corner, both the number and variety of court convictions have risen and financial institutions can point to solid results from giving staff more awareness training; 42,555 suspicious transaction reports were made in 2015 compared to 37,188 in 2014. The momentum has been mainlined this year with 13,297 reports made in the first quarter (seeJoint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1

The value of assets “restrained”, or interceded but not ceased, varies greatly depending on the complexity of the prosecution: in the first quarter of 2016 the figure was a fairly insignificant HK$73.5 million compared to HK$341.5 million in 2015, HK$418.9 million in 2014 and HK$873.4 million in 2013 (seeJoint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1

3703,31426,"Despite these gains, high-profile legal setbacks may derail Hong Kong’s FATF report card. At the time of going to press, Carson Yeung’s final appeal has been heard at the top court (May 31 to 2 June 2016).",2
3704,31427,"Yeung was granted leave to appeal (HKSAR (applicant) v Yeung Ka Sing, Carson (Respondent), FAMC 28&29 of 2015) in August last year. The fact that Yeung was granted bail pending the outcome has prompted optimism among critics of Hong Kong’s “draconian” money laundering laws that a robust overhaul would ensue.",2
3705,31428,"Yeung was convicted of five charges of dealing with property known or believed to represent the proceeds of an indictable offence, by using five bank accounts to launder HK$721 million between 2 January 2001 and 31 December 2007, contrary to s. 25(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) (“OSCO”).",3
3706,31429,"One of the issues to be dealt with was whether the prosecution must prove that the proceeds (the “property’’) being dealt with in a money laundering charge derives from a criminal act. Heavy criticism has been meted out for the approach taken in Hong Kong. In the UK, the prosecution must prove a predicate offence.",2
3707,31430,"One of the questions posed in Yeung’s appeal is whether Oei Hengky Wiryo v SAR (No. 2) (2007) 10 HKCFAR 98 was wrongly decided on this issue. The mens rea for the offence was also under scrutiny and the operation of the rule against duplicity was also to be considered. If it is felt by the CFA that this is not a safe conviction, it remains to be seen in what kind of shape the ordinance emerges. Should prosecutors have to prove a predicate offence, the bar for a conviction would be set significantly higher.",1
3708,31431,"In theory, one area of progress Hong Kong should be able to report to the FATF is a system for cross-border currency disclosure, after it was labelled as non-compliant back in 2012 due to an inadequate system for disclosing and declaring cross border transactions.",3
3709,31432,"FATF did credit Hong for its April 2012 initiative to adopt a mixed system of declarations for inbound passengers and disclosure for outbound ones, setting the threshold for reporting at HK$120,000. The global watchdog lauded this “fast-track” approach as it expected the legislation to be presented “within 2014.” However, it was not until 2015 that a public consultation was carried out.",1
3710,31433,"Given the challenges posed by Hong Kong’s polarised legislature, the fact that lawmakers baulked at the very idea of a declaration system does not bode well for legislation passing any time soon. Already tourism industry figures have spurned the plans as mainland visitors tend to shop using large sums of cash. Lawmaker Christopher Chung Shu-kun commented last year that HK$120,000 “is not even enough to buy a watch.”",1
3711,31434,"The latest update came in February 2016 when it was stated that the Security Bureau would collate feedback with a view to implementing the system, although no time frame was given. The impression was given of the issue being left in the long grass.",1
3712,31435,"Arguably, it would be easier to focus on Hong Kong’s deep bench of legal and accounting professionals. Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professionals (“DNFBPs”) featured prominently in the 2012 report and in particular the disparity between sanctions the various professions face.",1
3713,31436,"It was noted that DNFBPs were reticent to submit reports. There has been progress on this front – while in 2007 there were just nine suspicious transaction reports (“STRs”) by lawyers, three from accountants and five from trust and company service providers (“TCSPs”), in 2015 the legal sector provided 894. The increase for accountants and TCSPs was less impressive, with the professions providing six and 22 STRs respectively in 2015 (for the 2007 figures, see FATF Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong, China, 19 Oct 2012, p. 33; for the 2015 & 2016 figures, see Joint Financial Intelligence Unit Statistics).",1
3714,31437,"Perhaps the most pressing question is what will be the catalyst to shift Hong Kong’s somewhat anomalous approach to cross-border financial reporting. The betting must be that Beijing will increasingly want to regulate such monetary flows both from the perspective of macro-prudential financial stability and anti-corruption initiatives. As the country seeks to become a top-tier financial player it will be pulled toward the adoption of international norms, and so pressure will fall on Hong Kong to become truly FATF compliant.",1

3716,31439,"There are increasingly aggressive efforts by regulators and now by the judiciary in Hong Kong in combating money laundering. The recent judgment of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (“ CFA ”) in HKSAR v Yeung Ka Sing Carson serves as a timely reminder of the potential substantial risks in failed AML efforts. The CFA has confirmed, among other things, that on a charge of dealing with proceeds of crime contrary to s 25 (1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, the prosecution only needs to show that when an accused dealt with certain property, he or she knew, or had reasonable grounds to believe that such property represented the proceeds of an indictable offence.

3811,34284,"Hong Kong people are familiar enough with conditions on the mainland: the disappearance of dissidents, the denial of access to family and lawyers, the forced confessions, and other horrors no civilized society will tolerate. Families are ostracized and children have to also pay the price along with those the party punishes. That is an old imperial tradition the party has adopted to terrorize citizens. Hong Kong residents do not want China’s abuse of people the CCP dislikes to be normalized.",1

It will not subject itself to open election by the people it claims to represent. It does not brook opposition, or criticism from anyone outside itself. Even within, it can cast out those who hold a mirror to it — like Deng Xiaoping was, thrice. It decides guilt and punishment. Showcase trials are staged with victims confessing to scripted crimes.",1
3813,34286,"Once formalized into a legal routine, Hong Kong people fear the rendition will creep from criminals to political activity, freedom of expression, and all other individual and social rights which Hong Kong has long enjoyed.

3815,34288,"The Hong Kong government cited Chan’s case as the urgency to rush the flawed and dangerous extradition amendments, which would give the CCP an opening to finger Hong Kong residents for trial on the mainland. Hong Kong residents fear that more than anything else, knowing how opaque the system is. Assurances of noble intent are meaningless. People took to the streets to protest, as the legislature is stuffed with a majority of CCP proxies, who rubber stamp ‘national security’-type legislation as instructed, while their chief executive is powerless to protect Hong Kong society.",1

3911,34384,"The Background: From 1841, Hong Kong was governed as a British colony.

If this happens—similar plans have been postponed before—President Trump will say he is simply enforcing US law. His critics will insist he's capsizing the lives of thousands of people, including children, for political gain. The less predictable part of this story is the human drama that thousands of arrests will create—and the political firestorm that will surely follow.",1

3928,34401,"The Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matter Ordinance (Amendment) Bill 2019, commonly referred to as the extradition law amendment bill, has been the subject of a political debate in Hong Kong society, and reflects the reality that it’s a duel between truth and lies amid tense global strategies between two of the world’s major powers.",1
3929,34402,"The story behind the extradition law amendment bill is not complicated — Hong Kong resident Chan Tong-kai had allegedly murdered his girlfriend in Taiwan and dumped her body there before sneaking back to Hong Kong. Although he had admitted having killed his girlfriend after Hong Kong police arrested him, the SAR government must amend the two relevant laws to make way for a formal agreement with the Taiwan authorities concerning the matter — it’s procedural justice. The SAR government cannot extradite Chan to Taiwan before completing the necessary legislative process because it’s illegal unless authorized by Hong Kong law. Under the rule of law, the government must abide by existing laws every step of the way. One may ask why the government cannot make the amended extradition laws applicable only to requests by Taiwan, and not those by the Chinese mainland or Macao; and why the bill cannot include a “sunset clause” that makes the amendments expire as soon as Chan is handed over to Taiwan police. The answer is simple: More and more people are traveling between the mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao on a daily basis and no one can guarantee Chan is the only one of his kind Hong Kong ever has to extradite. The SAR government must plug the loopholes in the two ordinances concerned before more cases like Chan’s pop up. Why can’t the bill be delayed? Chan is currently serving a prison sentence in Hong Kong for money laundering and could go free as early as this October before the Legislative Council comes back from summer recess. No one can guarantee he will not flee or offend again.",3
3930,34403,"Obviously, the extradition law amendment bill is a legitimate, sensible and reasonable piece of legislation that should and must be approved in time. That’s why the majority of Hong Kong residents support it, as shown by the fact that the number of signatures supporting the bill had exceeded 510,000 over the weekend",1
3931,34404,"Obviously, the extradition law amendment bill is a legitimate, sensible and reasonable piece of legislation that should and must be approved in time. That’s why the majority of Hong Kong residents support it, as shown by the fact that the number of signatures supporting the bill had exceeded 510,000 over the weekend. Taiwan’s judicial department has responded positively to the HKSAR government’s move and wished it success. People in their right mind tend to choose the good over the bad when the overall interest of the community is at stake.",1
3932,34405,"On the bad side are Hong Kong’s opposition camp and the pro-independence administration in Taiwan, as well as a bunch of Western governments led by Washington. They have revealed their dark and sinister side by mounting an all-out campaign against the extradition law amendments. The ugliness of their anti-China farce has disgusted many people beyond imagination and the world deserves to know what exactly their motive is.",1
3933,34406,"The opposition camp in Hong Kong has gone so far as to swear that “everyone could be handed over to the mainland” and some of them had gone to the other side of the globe to beg their Western masters for support and even launch a counter popularity campaign with forged signatures. In doing so, they aim to regain some confidence lost as a result of the “Occupy Central” movement five years ago on the one hand and win a major fight against the SAR government before upcoming elections on the other. In that sense, the SAR government, by introducing the proposed extradition law changes, is like throwing the opposition a “lifeline” when the latter is drowning. If it’s not the extradition law amendment bill, it would be some other important issues or policies that may present the opposition camp an opportunity to blackmail the SAR government at the expense of Hong Kong society.",1
3934,34407,"On the Western powers’ side, leading the assault is the US government, with Congress, the consulate and business chambers all lending their voices to the shrilling chorus of threats and coercion in an attempt to intimidate the SAR government into withdrawing the bill. Unprecedented as it is, the blatant act of foreign interference in Hong Kong affairs is not hard to understand if one sees the backdrop of the escalating dispute between China and the US. As long as China’s peaceful development and national rejuvenation make Washington uncomfortable, the latter will do everything in its power to contain China by joining forces with its allies around the world. In this strategic game, Hong Kong is a card that Washington will use against China whenever it wants to whether it should or not. That means whatever the SAR government does with the extradition law amendment bill cannot and will not change Washington’s mind. So, the idea of withdrawing the bill to avoid US “sanctions” is both worthless and naive.",1
3935,34408,"The government in Taiwan has ignored the need for justice and rule of law by rejecting a rendition arrangement with the HKSAR, saying such an agreement would “reduce” it to a regional government and “put the people of Taiwan in danger”. That is just another political fig leaf. There is no question of Taiwan being “reduced” to a regional government if it accepts the one-China principle. By refusing to accept the one-China principle, it only means it has “Taiwan independence” in mind. As for “putting the people of Taiwan in danger”, the current government in Taiwan is doing exactly that by rejecting efforts to extradite a murder suspect from Hong Kong to Taiwan to face justice and leaving the door open for such crimes in future.",1
3936,34409,"People will ultimately see the truth when the lies spread about it are nailed. The political arm wrestling over the extradition law amendment bill has shown the world that the HKSAR government is responsible, accountable, unflinching in the face of threats and intimidation but willing to respect popular wish when necessary. It has also proved the central government’s strong support for the SAR government, as well as Hong Kong society’s faith in true justice. As for the forces trying to block the extradition law amendment bill, there is no hope of bringing them around at this point. The only way to preserve justice for the victims of crime and let potential criminals know that Hong Kong does not offer them refuge from justice is to support the LegCo in approving the extradition law amendment bill as soon as possible.",1

3941,34414,"It was just a local crime story at first, the details dribbling out in the tabloid press. Then in February, nearly a year after Chan’s arrest, the Hong Kong government cited the case to propose legislation that would allow the city to transfer criminal suspects to Taiwan and other places with which it lacks an extradition treaty – including mainland China.",1
3942,34415,"Seizing on the sensational crime as Exhibit A in a rushed campaign to push through the measure, Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, and her superiors in the Chinese leadership seemed confident they had a winning strategy. As it turned out, they badly underestimated public fear and suspicion of Beijing’s encroachment on this semiautonomous former British colony.",1
3943,34416,"In a rare retreat for president Xi Jinping’s government, Lam finally yielded to the pressure Saturday, suspending her push for the legislation while resisting demands to withdraw it completely and resign. From the start, critics labelled the extradition plan a “Trojan horse” that would allow Beijing to target political dissidents and others in Hong Kong who ran afoul of party officials. As popular outrage spread, Lam and her allies stuck to the script, arguing that Hong Kong needed the Bill to bring Chan to justice – even after the authorities in Taiwan made clear that was not true. Taiwanese officials said as early as May that they would not seek Chan’s extradition under the proposed legislation.",1
3944,34417,"Their objection to the Bill echoed that of the people of Hong Kong: the courts and security forces in mainland China, all controlled by the ruling Communist Party, could not be trusted. Lam’s repeated invocation of the Poon family’s grief was seen as just “political opportunism at its worst”, said Dennis Kwok, an opposition politician.",1
3945,34418,"The Hong Kong police could not charge Chan with murder for a crime committed in Taiwan. Instead, he was held and eventually convicted on money laundering charges for using Poon’s credit cards after her death. In April, a court in Hong Kong sentenced him to 29 months in prison. With time served while awaiting trial and good behaviour, he could be released as soon as October. An autopsy indicated Poon had been four to five months pregnant.",1
3946,34419,"For months, there was no sign the case would be at the centre of an international dispute. Then, in December, prosecutors in Taiwan obtained an arrest warrant for Chan. The government said it had reached out three times to authorities in Hong Kong to discuss how he might be extradited. All three requests went unanswered, according to Chiu Chui-cheng, a deputy minister of Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, the agency responsible for policy toward China.",1
3947,34420,"There were two interrelated problems: China does not recognise the government of Taiwan, which it considers part of its territory. And Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997, does not have an extradition agreement with Taiwan. Two months later, just before the anniversary of Poon’s killing, Lam made her move. Her government submitted papers to Hong Kong’s Legislative Council that cited the killing in proposing legislation that would allow extraditions on a “case-by-case” basis to jurisdictions with which Hong Kong lacks a formal extradition agreement.",1
3948,34421,The plan covered Taiwan – but also mainland China. And that was a big deal. Hong Kong had never allowed extraditions to mainland China – a safeguard agreed upon when Britain returned the territory and Beijing promised it a high degree of autonomy.,1
3949,34422,"Opposition built steadily. Thousands attended a protest against the measure in March, and in April tens of thousands rallied against it outside the Legislative Council. Politicians arguing about the Bill scuffled in the legislature; one was carried out on a stretcher.",1
3950,34423,"Lam, a career civil servant who was installed by Beijing in 2017, assured the public that the legislation would not apply to political crimes. But even within her insular council of advisers – like herself, unelected – there was unease. The territory’s top finance officials, for example, were dismayed when they learned the Bill would also allow Beijing to begin requesting freezes on assets in Hong Kong.",1
3951,34424,"Then, in May, Taiwan dramatically undercut Lam’s argument by declaring it would not seek Chan’s extradition even if the Bill passed. “Without the removal of threats to the personal safety of nationals going to or living in Hong Kong caused by being extradited to mainland China,” said Chiu, “we will not agree to the case-by-case transfer proposed by the Hong Kong authorities.”",1
3952,34425,"Lam has said she decided to pursue the extradition law herself, without prodding from Xi or other Chinese leaders. But China’s propaganda outlets took a hard line against the Hong Kong protesters, accusing them of conspiring with China’s enemies abroad. Several senior Communist Party officials in Beijing also endorsed the legislation.",1
3953,34426,"That helped transform the debate into a broader fight over the erosion of civil liberties under Chinese rule – and Hong Kong’s future as a global financial centre. For five years, since the failure of the Umbrella Movement demanding free elections, Hong Kong’s pro-democracy opposition had been on the defensive. But the extradition Bill gave it a chance to rally the public against something easy to understand: the possibility of being arrested and sent to mainland China.",1
3954,34427,"On Friday, Lam quietly travelled across the border to the mainland city of Shenzhen, where she consulted with senior Chinese officials. Some had flown in from Beijing, and a few of the Communist Party’s top experts on Hong Kong were there, too. (Xi was out of the country, celebrating his birthday with president Vladimir Putin of Russia at a regional summit in Tajikistan.)",1
3955,34428,"There was a consensus: given the public’s reaction, Lam should delay the legislation indefinitely. Announcing the decision on Saturday, she raised Chan’s case again in defending the measure, but finally acknowledged that Taiwan’s position meant there was no rush to pass it. “We will adopt the most sincere and humble attitude to accept criticisms and make improvements,” she said. – New York Times",1

3980,33891,"Last week, hundreds of thousands in Hong Kong held a candlelight vigil for the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre 30 years ago. And on Sunday, roughly 1 million people demonstrated in the semi-autonomous Chinese city-state against amendments to an extradition law that would allow a person arrested in Hong Kong to face trial elsewhere, including in mainland China.",1
3981,33892,"The passion is understandable. For many, the amendments would all but cement Beijing’s authority in a city that’s supposed to be allowed to operate mostly on its own for three more decades. The problem for demonstrators is that the measures will likely pass as soon as Wednesday, due to a legislature and leader that answer to Beijing.",1

3984,33895,"After taking over Hong Kong in a war in the 1800s, Britain returned it to China in 1997 with an important stipulation: The city would partly govern itself for 50 years before fully falling under Beijing’s control. So until 2047, the expectation was that the city and the mainland would operate under the principle known as “one country, two systems.”",1
3985,33896,"But Beijing clearly isn’t waiting that long. “In recent years, the Hong Kong government has disqualified elected lawmakers, banned activists from running for office, prohibited a political party, jailed pro-democracy leaders, expelled a senior foreign journalist, and looked the other way when Beijing kidnapped its adversaries in Hong Kong,” Ben Bland, a Hong Kong expert at the Lowy Institute in Australia, told me.",1
3986,33897,"Those actions, among others, have animated many in the city to resist. “Being here reminds me that the Chinese government is so inhumane and, recently, they are tightening the rule of law in Hong Kong,” Tiffany, a 23-year-old university student who attended the candlelight vigil last week, told the Asia Times on June 5.",1

Chan Tong-kai, a local, was suspected of killing his pregnant girlfriend while the two were on vacation in Taiwan. But the city was unable to send him back to the island because they don’t share an extradition agreement.",3
3988,33899,"The reason? When Hong Kong’s extradition accords were being finalized in 1997, Taiwan and China weren’t included because the mainland has a “fundamentally different criminal justice system operating in the mainland” and because of “concerns over the mainland’s track record on the protection of fundamental rights,” according to an April statement by the Hong Kong Bar Association.",1
3989,33900,"That reality doesn’t sit well with Hong Kong’s current government. Lam, the chief executive, cited Chan’s case among two reasons she wants the amendments passed. “One is of course to provide a legal basis for us to deal with the Taiwan case; the other is to plug a loophole in the existing arrangements for the return or the surrender of fugitive offenders,” she told reporters in April before a government meeting.",1
3990,33901,"The amendments would give the chief executive the authority to decide on a case-by-case basis if a suspected criminal should be extradited to a place with which the city has no formal extradition agreement. That on its own is already a problem for critics, as the city’s leader isn’t elected, but rather is picked by a committee appointed by the government in Beijing.",1
3991,33902,"What’s more, while the city’s courts would get to review the chief executive’s decision, they will have “very little power to reject any extradition request,” M.K. Tam, director of the human rights group Amnesty International Hong Kong, told Al Jazeera on Tuesday. “It’s not a formal prosecution so you cannot examine the evidence presented by the other side.”",1
3992,33903,"“We all know that if they want to prosecute someone — a human rights defender or activist — actually in mainland China, the charges are political in nature but they use other laws to prosecute them,” Tam continued.",1
3993,33904,"However, supporters of the law contend that certain financial crimes won’t be included in the bill, potentially saving the city’s influential business leaders from extradition. They also say that no one will be sent away if they might be tortured or killed as part of their punishment, and that the offense must be illegal both in Hong Kong and wherever the suspect is extradited.",1
3994,33905,"That’s still not enough to assuage those who’ve long championed the city’s judicial values. “Both Hong Kong and China knew very well that there had to be a firewall between our different legal systems,” Hong Kong’s last British governor, Chris Patten, told the South China Morning Post in May, adding that Lam’s position is “absurd.”",1
3995,33906,"China is an authoritarian state.

4135,34046,"Even though the government – stunned by the huge turnout – shelved the proposal, the issue of Article 23 never went away.

4136,34047,"But despite the regular reminders, reviving Article 23 never gained much traction. Nearly 16 years after the 2003 protest, there is still very little public appetite for restarting debate on national security legislation. Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, aware the emotive issue could trigger further societal polarization, has repeatedly said the current political climate precludes putting Article 23 back on the table.",1
4137,34048,"But that long-held position may now be shifting, judging from recent marks by Lam and Beijing’s top representative here, Wang Zhimin. In a toughly-worded speech last week, Wang claimed some local politicians were colluding with anti-China forces to threaten national security by playing the Hong Kong card. He went as far as to say China is today facing its worst national security threat since the end of the cold war, hinting it was time Hong Kong enacted Article 23.",1

No one can say for sure, given the fact that mainland leaders often speak in vague terms that leave people guessing.

Again, no one can say for sure if this is true, given the opaqueness of how much autonomy Beijing allows Hong Kong’s chief executives.",1
4142,34053,"My opinion is that every nation has a right to enact laws to protect national security. Western countries, particularly the US, have very tough national security laws which came into effect after the September 2001 terror attacks in the US. Sooner or later, Hong Kong has to enact Article 23 and there is no time like the present.",1

What I do believe is there is little chance the political climate will improve anytime soon to the level Lam wants to restart public discussion on either Article 23 or democratic reforms, given the huge ideological divide in our society. For that reason, if Lam wants to enact Article 23 during her current term, she needs to walk a tightrope by producing a proposal that protects our civil liberties yet satisfies her Beijing bosses.",1
4144,34055,"It’s a tough call. Any new national security legislation will have to be even tougher than the one that was shelved in 2003 because back then we didn’t have an independence movement, localism, social media, and public sentiment that Beijing is tightening its grip on Hong Kong. But I believe it should be done once and for all so that it no longer hangs over us like a Damocles Sword. It’s an open question whether Lam has the political savvy to achieve this Herculean task.",1
4145,34056,"Each country has its own definition of national security, which is why what Lam may consider imperative to protect the country may be seen by certain sectors of our society as infringements on civil liberties.

It even got the Hong Kong government to ban a tiny pro-independence party with minimal public backing and zero means to launch terror attacks on any scale that could threaten national security.,1
4148,34059,The US has launched a global campaign against Huawei on the grounds that its links to China’s Communist Party pose national security threats to countries that allow Huawei into their networks. China alleges this global campaign is an American attempt to prevent its rise.

4190,34135,"Organisers estimated attendance for the initial protest march at over one million, making it the largest the city has seen since 2003, raising the spectre of social unrest; anathema to Beijing. Although the Legislative Council (LegCo) proceedings have now been suspended, with Chief Executive Carrie Lam saying she will seek further consultations and implying that the bill will not pass this year, it is probable that the issue of extradition will return in some form despite the protests of Hong Kongers and the concerns of the international community.",1
4191,34136,"The Hong Kong Government’s climb-down appears to be a triumph for people-power in a city where the level of political activism puts most Western societies to shame. Such demonstrations are needed because Hong Kong is not a true democracy, despite often being cited as such. The system bestowed on the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) following the departure of the British in 1997 is in truth more of an authoritarian regime with democratic window-dressing than true rule of the people. Heavily weighted in favour of the pro-Beijing establishment, with “business functional” constituencies providing 35 of the 70 members of the LegCo, the electoral system ensures Beijing’s influence is irresistible despite a reliable and healthy voter turnout for the territory’s myriad of pro-democracy, localist and pro-Independence parties.",1
4192,34137,"Concerns that an extradition agreement with the mainland would be open to abuse and endanger the freedoms of the Hong Kong public more broadly seem justified given China’s current intolerance to dissent from all quarters, even to humorous extremes such as banning Winnie the Pooh. Indeed, changes to the extradition arrangement, which US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said “chillingly showcases Beijing’s brazen willingness to trample over the law to silence dissent and stifle the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong”, are only the latest in a string of encroachments into Hong Kong’s political and legal spheres by the mainland in recent years. Since the Umbrella Movement and Occupy Central protests of 2014, several pro-democracy activists have been jailed on minor or trumped-up charges. This list includes Umbrella Movement activist Joshua Wong, and six pro-democracy LegCo members who won seats in the 2016 elections, but were disqualified from their elected positions following judicial reviews into their official oath-taking. Freedom of the press has come under serious attack, and fears have been growing over Beijing’s willingness to wade in and pass judgement on Hong Kong’s separate legal system, with a 2014 Chinese government White Paper saying that Hong Kong’s “high degree of autonomy” is in fact subject to oversight from Beijing, including in legal matters pertaining to the interpretation of Hong Kong’s Basic Law.",1
4193,34138,"There is a case to be made for some form of extradition agreement, the need for which has been recognised since before the 1997 handover. More recently however, the lack of an extradition treaty between Hong Kong and Taiwan has led to the high-profile case of Chan Tong-kai, which was seized on by lawmakers as evidence of the bill’s necessity. Chan, who murdered his girlfriend in Taiwan and escaped to Hong Kong, was imprisoned on the lesser charge of money laundering on his return to Hong Kong but is currently safe from facing murder charges in Taiwan. However, concerns over the scope of the bill and its potential to undermine, if not completely overturn, the One Country, Two Systems model are well-founded. Should it ever pass, the bill will put Hong Kongers, as well as foreigners visiting the city, on the event horizon of China’s black hole legal system.",1
4194,34139,"Leaving aside the Chan case, the question is posed as to why the extradition amendments are being proposed now and if the end result is really worth the trouble for Beijing. While the ability of Chinese dissidents, businessmen and corrupt officials to flee to Hong Kong has long frustrated Beijing, the hitherto lack of an extradition agreement has not stopped the long arm of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from reaching into Hong Kong. The case of the Causeway Bay booksellers and the abduction of Xiao Jianhua in 2017 prove that extraordinary rendition is a tool China is more than willing to use. Given Hong Kong’s history of mass protests and desire to remain somewhat separate from the mainland, it is hard to believe that either Beijing or the LegCo expected such a bill to pass without scenes the like of which have taken place this past week. It is also unlikely that Chief Executive Lam would unilaterally embark on such a controversial piece of legislation without the backing of Beijing, which has been reaffirmed by Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang.",1
4195,34140,"It is difficult to know to what extent Beijing may have been behind the extradition bill, and Carrie Lam has insisted that the idea was entirely her own – a claim supported by China’s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming when he warned the UK against intervention over the issue. Following the passing of other controversial legislation in recent years like the national anthem law, along with the failure of protests to prevent the establishment of mainland immigration checks in West Kowloon, Lam may have believed she could pass the extradition bill without any major issues. What seems likely is that Lam miscalculated the mood of the people and saw an opportunity to please Beijing by moving ahead with the bill, only to be told to back down when opposition erupted. If this is the case, Lam has probably damaged her credibility with the CCP, as backing down in the face of popular protest is not something Beijing will want to establish a precedent for. The China Daily was keen to downplay the success of the protesters by praising the “administration’s responsiveness to public opinion” having previously claimed broad support in the HKSAR for the bill, while the nationalist newspaper the Global Times made characteristically shrill claims that foreign influences were driving the protests. Although the Chinese press unsurprisingly low-balled the number of protesters while playing up the level of violence instigated by the predominantly peaceful crowds, the Hong Kong police’s reputation has also suffered, with their heavy-handed approach drawing criticism from foreign observers and further tarnishing a reputation already damaged by their handling of the 2014 Umbrella Movement. With the police now on their best behaviour under heavy international scrutiny, Hong Kongers continue to take to the street in vast numbers to demand the complete withdrawal of the bill and the resignation of Carrie Lam. Lam, who has delivered a contrite apology, looks to have established herself as the most unpopular Chief Executive in Hong Kong’s history and may now have lost the confidence of Beijing.",1

Hong Kong police announced that they want to clear the streets of protesters Monday morning. Soon after, police lined up several officers deep and faced off against several hundred demonstrators on a street in central Hong Kong. (AP Photo/Vincent Yu)",1
4269,36769,SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/ANN) – Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam apologized on June 17 to the city’s residents and promised to serve them better after hundreds of thousands took to the streets once more to denounce a Bill that would allow extradition to China.,1
4270,36770,"Her apology came after weeks of intense pressure to scrap proposed amendments to the law that many people in Hong Kong, from students to lawyers and business leaders, felt was another sign of Beijing’s creeping interference in the city’s rights and freedoms.",1
4271,36771,"The police have also been criticized for their heavy-handed tactics during the June 9 mass protest, which descended into violent clashes, and again last Wednesday, during which rubber bullets and tear gas were used against demonstrators.",1
4272,36772,"“The Chief Executive admitted that the deficiencies in the government’s work had led to substantial controversies and disputes in society, causing disappointment and grief among the people,” said a government statement issued yesterday evening.",1
4273,36773,"Many of those taking part wore black, and the protest continued late into the night, with thousands gathered outside the government complex, using their mobile phones as torches and shouting “stay strong Hong Kong” and “withdraw” in Cantonese.",1
4274,36774,The government had announced on Saturday that it was postponing the Bill indefinitely. But many protesters felt this was not enough and went ahead with yesterday’s protest to press for the Bill to be scrapped and for Lam to step down.,1
4275,36775,"Hebe Lau, who is in her 30s and works in finance, told The Straits Times she was at the rally to send a signal to the Hong Kong government that the Bill must be withdrawn. “Postponing is just an excuse to all Hong Kong citizens and cannot even be considered a victory at all,” she said.",1
4276,36776,"Except for a short opinion piece in the People’s Daily, Chinese state media – which has drummed up support for the Bill in recent weeks – kept mum. China’s state broadcaster, CCTV, avoided the subject in its main news bulletins.",1
4277,36777,"Protest leaders said the move to suspend the Bill indefinitely is simply an attempt to kick the issue into the long grass. “I believe the protest must carry on until we see the real withdrawal of the Bill,” said vice-convener of the CHRF Bonnie Leung.",1
4278,36778,"“As we have been lied to so many times, we don’t believe in a mere suspension. If the whole Bill does not go through, they will dismantle it into smaller pieces and they would put it out one by one to get less notice from the public in order to pass it.”",1
4279,36779,"Organizers CHRF are also calling for a general strike today. The Bill was first mooted in February following the murder of a Hong Kong woman by her Hong Konger boyfriend in Taiwan. The man, Chan Tong Kai, escaped prosecution in Taiwan by simply returning home as Hong Kong does not have an extradition agreement with Taiwan.",2
4280,36780,"The Hong Kong government said safeguards have been added since the Bill was tweaked after consultation, following pushback from critics. One of the six additional safeguards is raising the threshold for offenses to be covered by extradition to imprisonment for seven years or more, from the initial three years. ●",1

4282,36782,"By Jay Tharappel – Western propaganda comes in two types, 1) we attack them for our benefit (realism), and 2) we save them for their benefit (liberalism), and when it comes to Hong Kong, both the Left and Right of the Anglo world tend towards the latter, actually thinking the political unrest is vaguely because China wants to impose laws on Hong Kong to extradite “human rights” and “democracy” campaigners.",1
4283,36783,"The Greens have said they are “deeply concerned” because the “new extradition agreement…will expose people to China’s unjust system” where “fair trial is chronically denied”. The only reason many think this is about “activists” is because of two people, “Ray Wong, 25, and Alan Li, 27”, who are currently living in asylum in Germany, of whom, “Wong said he feared it could be used to suppress the pro-democracy movement”, however it’s never explained on what grounds they could be extradited to the mainland if they’re committing crimes in Hong Kong, given the “two … activists [are] facing rioting charges at home”, meaning the extradition bill isn’t even needed to prosecute them.",2
4284,36784,"The Hong Kong parliament wants to introduce the Fugitives Offenders Ordinance amendment bill which would “allow case-by-case transfers of people to countries without extradition treaties, including China” but also to “Taiwan and Macau”. This is to fix “a “loophole” that they claim has allowed the city to become a haven for criminals from the mainland” and that’s because “there is no formal mechanism for the surrender of fugitives to mainland China”. This is why in early 2018 a Hong Kong resident Chan Tong-kai got away with killing his wife Poon Hiu-wing in Taiwan (not the mainland, but same problem) and stealing her money, because “the police were unable to charge him for murder or extradite him to Taiwan because no agreement is in place.”",2
4285,36785,"The real background to this story, the economic elephant in the room, is that from 1980 to 2016, the third-world lost nearly $16.3 trillion USD in capital flight, of which the Chinese share represents around 28%, much of it exiting via Hong Kong. By 2016 it had been reported that the Chinese central bank had “burned through $800bn of foreign reserves since mid-2014, when they peaked at $4 trillion” because of capital flight. However, “if the bill becomes law, it will be possible for mainland Chinese courts to request Hong Kong courts to freeze and confiscate assets related to crimes committed on the mainland, beyond an existing provision covering the proceeds of drug offences”.",3
4286,36786,"This is now why “Hong Kong’s business community has expressed concern over the inclusion of economic and financial crimes in the bill”, and why “some Hong Kong tycoons have started moving personal wealth offshore”, that is, they are fleeing with their money to the safe havens of the Anglo financial empire, to fuel debt, consumption and asset bubbles. Ever since the Opium wars in the 19th century, when Qing dynasty China was forced to cede control of Hong Kong to the British empire, it has been a conduit for draining China of capital (then silver) in exchange for opium. Given that HSBC which was founded by the British in Hong Kong is still helping Mexican drug cartels launder money, it seems much hasn’t changed",3

4289,36789,"Mark Field said at a parliamentary debate on Monday that recent government concessions fell short of protecting the city’s autonomy and judicial independence: “There are widespread concerns that fear of extradition to China might have a chilling effect on Hong Kong’s rights and freedoms and result in increased self-censorship,” he said. “… Hong Kong must enjoy the full measure of its high degree of autonomy and rule of law as set out in the joint declaration and enshrined in the Basic Law.”",1
4290,36790,"Hong Kong’s government first proposed legal amendments in February to allow the city to handle case-by-case extradition requests from jurisdictions with no prior agreements, most notably China and Taiwan. The plan would enable the chief executive and local courts to handle extradition requests without legislative oversight. The bill could pass next Thursday, with democrats, lawyers,journalists, foreign politicians and businesses raising concerns over the risk of residents being tried in the mainland, where there are few human rights protections.",1
4291,36791,The plan was prompted by a murder case involving Hong Kong resident Chan Tong-kai who evaded justice after allegedly murdering his girlfriend in Taipei last year. Local police were unable to extradite him from Hong Kong as no prior agreement was in place.,2
4292,36792,"Field noted that Taiwan’s cross-strait affairs council has said it would not seek to extradite the murder suspect even if the bill was passed: “There is a potential loophole, but it is interesting to note that it is not one that the Taiwanese authorities have asked to be sorted out,” he said.",1
4293,36793,"Washington also echoed earlier statements by expressing “grave concern” over the proposed amendments and warned that it could threaten the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, which affords the city privileges in economic and trade matters relating to the US.",1
4294,36794,"Morgan Ortagus, the spokesperson for the Department of State, said on Monday that the bill could harm regional business interests and expose US citizens residing in or visiting Hong Kong to China’s capricious legal system.",1
4295,36795,"“The United States shares the concern of many in Hong Kong that the lack of the procedural protections in the proposed amendments could undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy and negatively impact the territory’s long-standing protections of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democratic values as enshrined in the Basic Law and the Sino-British Joint Declaration,” she said. “The continued erosion of the One Country Two Systems framework puts at risk Hong Kong’s long-established special status in international affairs.”",1
4296,36796,"The 1992 Hong Kong Policy Act expresses support for the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which defines the city’s semi-autonomous nature.

4308,36808,"In a joint statement, the 23 pan-democrats said the secretariat had overstepped its authority by directly sending a written request to lawmakers. The circular concerned a non-binding guideline on To’s removal and whether each of the 62 lawmakers on the bills committee was in favour of it. The pro-government bloc has a majority on the committee.",1
4309,36809,The opposition camp also said it would not recognise Razack’s role in presiding over the committee and questioned whether the House Committee’s decision on Saturday to issue the non-binding guideline was legal. To said he would preside over Monday’s meeting regardless and had asked the secretariat to withdraw the circular.,1
4310,36810,"Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, the city’s No 2 official, said he hoped the issue could be sorted out as soon as possible so the work of scrutinising the bill could begin, adding the government was ready to listen to “constructive and feasible” views from the public.",1
4311,36811,"Meanwhile, the government was under pressure to explore alternative proposals for the bill, after prominent law scholar and Basic Law Committee member Albert Chen Hung-yee urged officials to “seriously consider” allowing Hongkongers to stand trial in local courts rather than being sent to the mainland.",1
4312,36812,"Chen’s colleague, leading human rights scholar Johannes Chan Man-mun, said the law should spell out that Hong Kong courts would have more say on rejecting an extradition request, if the requesting jurisdiction did not recognise international human rights agreements.",1

4391,36891,"Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you might’ve noticed Hongkongers’ have not been happy lately. On June 16, Hong Kong was brought to a standstill for the second time in two weeks by a mass protest that drew reportedly two million people to the streets over a proposed amendment to an existing bill. If you're feeling a little out of the loop and struggling to understand what all the fuss is about, let us give you a little crash course on what exactly is going in Hong Kong right now.",1
4392,36892,"How did it all start?In February 2018, a Hong Kong citizen Chan Tong-kai strangled his pregnant girlfriend, Poon Hiu-wing, during a trip to Taiwan. Chan disposed of the body by putting it in a suitcase and left it in the bushes before fleeing back to Hong Kong. Chan was eventually arrested and confessed to the crime when Poon’s body was found, yet Hong Kong authorities can only charge him with money laundering for using his girlfriend's credit cards. He was sentenced to 29 months in jail, as opposed to a life sentence for murder.",3
4393,36893,"This case is a complicated one for both Hong Kong and Taiwan. Since the crime wasn’t committed on Hong Kong soil, Hong Kong courts have no legal grounds to sentence Chan to prison for murder. The usual procedures for such cases would be to send the criminal back to the country where the crime was committed, but as our city doesn't share an extradition agreement with Taiwan, Hong Kong authorities’ hands are tied. This brings us to the current protests…",1
4394,36894,"What are the protests about?Chan’s situation highlighted a gap in local extradition laws. As a way to resolve it, the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the city’s existing law, allowing local and foreign criminal suspects in Hong Kong (including visitors) to be extradited to other jurisdictions – including mainland China – without legislative oversight. By doing so, Hong Kong can safely extradite Chan and any possible future fugitives out of our city. But things get a bit more complicated from here.",1
4395,36895,"The main issue is that mainland China doesn't exactly have the best track record when it comes to human rights. Many Hongkongers are concerned that the Chinese central government could use the new amendment as a tool to snap up democracy advocates, dissidents and other political opponents of the country. The proposed bill sparked outrage across the city, leading to mass protests over the course of two weeks that saw Hong Kong police using arguably excessive force, injured students and protestors arrested at the hospital on the grounds of rioting, and a man falling to his death in Admiralty on June 15.",1
4396,36896,"While the Hong Kong government announced the temporary suspension of the extradition bill on June 15, with chief executive Carrie Lam issuing a public apology the next day, many Hongkongers are left feeling unsatisfied and vulnerable about the future of Hong Kong’s democracy. The people took to the streets again the following day with a record-breaking turnout of two million, specifically demanding five things:",1
4397,36897,• Full withdrawal of the postponed extradition bill• Carrie Lam's resignation• An investigation into the police for using unnecessary violence• For all arrested demonstrators to be released• Total recall of claims that the June 12 demonstration was a riot,1
4398,36898,"How did the government respond?In an attempt to pacify protestors, Carrie Lam once again offered her 'most sincere apology' to every Hong Kong resident during a government press conference on June 18. In response to those demands, Lam has reiterated that the extradition bill is suspended until the government regains the people’s trust. Lam also said that it’s 'very unlikely' for the bill to be passed before the LegCo term ends next year. Regarding calls for her resignation, Lam has said she intends to remain in office and has asked for citizens to give her a second chance to rebuild people’s trust in the government The chief executive has also turned down the suggestion to set up an independent commission to look into police actions at the June 12 protest, adding that 'existing mechanisms' must be used.",1

However, suspicions were raised after Chan Tong-Kai, a nineteen-year-old student student at Hong Kong Polytechnic University’s Hong Kong Community College, returned alone on February 17th without his girlfriend, the twenty-year-old Poon Hiu-wing, who had been a student at the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education but dropped out of her program. When questioned by Poon’s father, Chan claimed that the two had argued and split, following which he ignored follow-up calls.",1

After reviewing security camera footage, Taipei police had discovered footage of Chan dragging a suspiciously large pink suitcase while leaving the Purple Garden Hotel where he and Poon had been staying. Hong Kong police claimed that the Taipei police had discovered security camera footage of the murder, following which Chan admitted to the killing, and stated that he had left the suitcase with the body in it in the vicinity of the Zhuwei MRT station. Chan reportedly suspected that his girlfriend was pregnant with another man’s child, which what led to the killing. It was later confirmed that Poon was indeed pregnant.",2

If the Poon murder case results in formalization of a standard process for handling cases of individuals facing charges in Hong Kong who have fled to Taiwan, this could set a negative precedent which would affect them. Namely, even if it was probably already true that such individuals would probably have continued to face the charges they fled from if deported by the Taiwanese government to Hong Kong, the Poon case could lead to demands from the Hong Kong government that Taiwan take action on other cases of Hong Kong suspects currently residing in Taiwan.",1

On June 16, Hong Kong was brought to a standstill for the second time in two weeks by a mass protest that drew reportedly two million people to the streets over a proposed amendment to an existing bill. If you're feeling a little out of the loop and struggling to understand what all the fuss is about, let us give you a little crash course on what exactly is going in Hong Kong right now.",1
4476,36360,"How did it all start?In February 2018, a Hong Kong citizen Chan Tong-kai strangled his pregnant girlfriend, Poon Hiu-wing, during a trip to Taiwan. Chan disposed of the body by putting it in a suitcase and left it in the bushes before fleeing back to Hong Kong. Chan was eventually arrested and confessed to the crime when Poon’s body was found, yet Hong Kong authorities can only charge him with money laundering for using his girlfriend's credit cards. He was sentenced to 29 months in jail, as opposed to a life sentence for murder.",3
4477,36361,"This case is a complicated one for both Hong Kong and Taiwan. Since the crime wasn’t committed on Hong Kong soil, Hong Kong courts have no legal grounds to sentence Chan to prison for murder. The usual procedures for such cases would be to send the criminal back to the country where the crime was committed, but as our city doesn't share an extradition agreement with Taiwan, Hong Kong authorities’ hands are tied. This brings us to the current protests…",1
4478,36362,"What are the protests about?Chan’s situation highlighted a gap in local extradition laws. As a way to resolve it, the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the city’s existing law, allowing local and foreign criminal suspects in Hong Kong (including visitors) to be extradited to other jurisdictions – including mainland China – without legislative oversight. By doing so, Hong Kong can safely extradite Chan and any possible future fugitives out of our city. But things get a bit more complicated from here.",1
4479,36363,"The main issue is that mainland China doesn't exactly have the best track record when it comes to human rights. Many Hongkongers are concerned that the Chinese central government could use the new amendment as a tool to snap up democracy advocates, dissidents and other political opponents of the country. The proposed bill sparked outrage across the city, leading to mass protests over the course of two weeks that saw Hong Kong police using arguably excessive force, injured students and protestors arrested at the hospital on the grounds of rioting, and a man falling to his death in Admiralty on June 15.",2

4482,36366,"How did the government respond?In an attempt to pacify protestors, Carrie Lam once again offered her 'most sincere apology' to every Hong Kong resident during a government press conference on June 18. In response to those demands, Lam has reiterated that the extradition bill is suspended until the government regains the people’s trust. Lam also said that it’s 'very unlikely' for the bill to be passed before the LegCo term ends next year. Regarding calls for her resignation, Lam has said she intends to remain in office and has asked for citizens to give her a second chance to rebuild people’s trust in the government The chief executive has also turned down the suggestion to set up an independent commission to look into police actions at the June 12 protest, adding that 'existing mechanisms' must be used.",1

Despite the extradition bill being suspended, without an official withdrawal, there is still a chance for the bill to be put back on the table.

4577,35466,"According to The New York Times, the protests continue to be a “stunning display of rising fear and anger over the erosion of the civil liberties” in Hong Kong. Protesters fear the extradition bill will lead to the deterioration of the territory’s democracy by providing mainland China the opportunity to extradite and convict people based on the mainland’s laws.",1
4578,35467,"A former British colony, Hong Kong is now a semi-independent territory under the control of the People’s Republic of China. Under the terms of a 1997 agreement, a “one country, two systems” policy allows the city to self-govern until 2047.

Many fear that China could use the law to arrest political dissidents. The protests have brought into sharp focus the contrasts between Hong Kong’s and China’s judicial systems.",1
4597,35486,"“The bill is controversial in my view for emotional reasons,” according to Tim Summers, a former diplomat and senior consulting fellow on the Asia-Pacific program at Chatham House, which is based in Hong Kong. “It brings to the fore distrust of the authorities in mainland China and highlights differences between Hong Kong’s robust rule of law and the more arbitrary system in mainland China.”",1

These protests had wide support across society, so many people just turned up. There was widespread publicity about the protests in advance and people share info rapidly on social media.”",1

With real implications for Taiwan, the international community would (and should) be very interested to see where this leads.”",1
4602,35491,"However, introduction of the extradition laws is ""ill-advised and unnecessary,"" according to Tsang, who said it reflects the top down approach of policy making by Chinese Premier Xi Jinping.

But the case contained a legal complication that would prove to be crucial: the Hong Kong judiciary did not have the authority to rule on a murder committed abroad by a foreigner and, in the absence of extradition treaty with Taiwan she could not send Chan Tong-kai back to a court in her country either.",1
4611,35500,"The young man has only been sentenced by Hong Kong for ... money laundering. The Taiwanese had, in fact, used the credit card of the deceased to withdraw the equivalent of just over $ 2,000 in the territory.

Shortly after his statements, the Taiwanese authorities revealed that they sent three requests to their Hong Kong colleagues to try to find a solution so that Chan Tong-kai could still be tried for murder. They never had a return, which seems to suggest that the Hong Kong government was not in such a hurry. Taiwan then cut the grass under the foot of Carrie Lam claiming in May not to request the extradition of Chan Tong-kai, under a text that ""would create a risk for [his] nationals visiting Hong Kong to be extradited to China "".",1

On June 16, Hong Kong was brought to a standstill for the second time in two weeks by a mass protest that drew reportedly two million people to the streets over a proposed amendment to an existing bill. If you're feeling a little out of the loop and struggling to understand what all the fuss is about, let us give you a little crash course on what exactly is going in Hong Kong right now.",1
4651,35540,"How did it all start?In February 2018, a Hong Kong citizen Chan Tong-kai strangled his pregnant girlfriend, Poon Hiu-wing, during a trip to Taiwan. Chan disposed of the body by putting it in a suitcase and left it in the bushes before fleeing back to Hong Kong. Chan was eventually arrested and confessed to the crime when Poon’s body was found, yet Hong Kong authorities can only charge him with money laundering for using his girlfriend's credit cards. He was sentenced to 29 months in jail, as opposed to a life sentence for murder.",3
4652,35541,"This case is a complicated one for both Hong Kong and Taiwan. Since the crime wasn’t committed on Hong Kong soil, Hong Kong courts have no legal grounds to sentence Chan to prison for murder. The usual procedures for such cases would be to send the criminal back to the country where the crime was committed, but as our city doesn't share an extradition agreement with Taiwan, Hong Kong authorities’ hands are tied. This brings us to the current protests…",1
4653,35542,"What are the protests about?Chan’s situation highlighted a gap in local extradition laws. As a way to resolve it, the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the city’s existing law, allowing local and foreign criminal suspects in Hong Kong (including visitors) to be extradited to other jurisdictions – including mainland China – without legislative oversight. By doing so, Hong Kong can safely extradite Chan and any possible future fugitives out of our city. But things get a bit more complicated from here.",1
4654,35543,"The main issue is that mainland China doesn't exactly have the best track record when it comes to human rights. Many Hongkongers are concerned that the Chinese central government could use the new amendment as a tool to snap up democracy advocates, dissidents and other political opponents of the country. The proposed bill sparked outrage across the city, leading to mass protests over the course of two weeks that saw Hong Kong police using arguably excessive force, injured students and protestors arrested at the hospital on the grounds of rioting, and a man falling to his death in Admiralty on June 15.",1
4655,35544,"While the Hong Kong government announced the temporary suspension of the extradition bill on June 15, with chief executive Carrie Lam issuing a public apology the next day, many Hongkongers are left feeling unsatisfied and vulnerable about the future of Hong Kong’s democracy.

In response to those demands, Lam has reiterated that the extradition bill is suspended until the government regains the people’s trust. Lam also said that it’s 'very unlikely' for the bill to be passed before the LegCo term ends next year. Regarding calls for her resignation, Lam has said she intends to remain in office and has asked for citizens to give her a second chance to rebuild people’s trust in the government The chief executive has also turned down the suggestion to set up an independent commission to look into police actions at the June 12 protest, adding that 'existing mechanisms' must be used.",1

4806,35620,"Tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents have taken to the streets to demand their government halt a plan that would make it easier to extradite people to the secretive judicial system in mainland China.The march organisers estimated that more than 100,000 people filed through central Hong Kong on Sunday. Police said the march drew 22,800 people at its peak.The plan proposed by the city’s security bureau, and pushed by Carrie Lam, the chief executive, would allow Hong Kong to send criminal suspects requested by China, Taiwan or Macau. None of those jurisdictions has a rendition agreement with Hong Kong. Hong Kongers fear the law will allow China to demand that Hong Kong turn over political dissidents, religious workers and business people whose work may violate some yet-to-be-written law.“They say if you’re innocent you shouldn’t be afraid,” said Alex Ho, a Catholic school teacher who marched most of the route carrying his 18-month-old daughter, Stella. “But the legal system in China changes. They can make up the law and say that people did whatever they want.”It was the biggest protest for several years, activists and journalists said, in a city known for a 79-day occupation for democratic elections in 2014.Some protesters said they showed up to support nine activists who were convicted earlier this month of public nuisance charges related to the 2014 event. Four of those were sentenced to prison, with two professors getting 16-month terms. Their supporters collected thousands of dollars for their appeals.Fears that the amendment will pass led one prominent resident to flee. Lam Wing-kee, who smuggled gossipy books about Chinese leaders, landed in Taiwan last week where he plans to seek residency. Lam disappeared in 2015 and resurfaced months later to say he’d been kidnapped and held by Chinese security. “If the ordinance is passed, I won’t be allowed to leave, because I have been charged with a crime and am wanted for it,” he told Bloomberg before leaving.Ronny Tong Ka-wah, a member of the executive council, the city’s advisory unit, urged the government not to favour public pressure. “If the government surrenders just because there are some opposing voices, I am afraid it will be difficult to have effective governance in the future,” he said, according to the South China Morning Post.The protest drew people who said they have never marched, or have not done so in years. “Everyone, whatever their background, everyone will be caught up by the central government [in Beijing] without reason,” said a civil servant who would identify herself only as Ada. She said she had not protested since 1989 when students sought democracy in China.Think about the booksellers and their forced confessions, said her friend, Iris. “You’re an idiot if you believe Carrie Lam,” she said.Hong Kong has many extradition agreements, but not with China, Taiwan or Macau in the nearly 22 years since Britain relinquished the territory. Hong Kong crafted this new proposal after Taiwanese officials asked Hong Kong to send a 19-year-old man wanted for the murder of his pregnant girlfriend. Hong Kong authorities arrested Chan Tong-kai but could only charge him with money laundering.Lam has urged Hong Kong’s legislature to pass the amendment before July. Otherwise, the city’s courts might free the suspect. Lawmaker Alvin Yeung offered a counter-proposal on Friday that would allow Hong Kong’s courts to try Chan for murder in local courts.Many international organisations have asked Lam to alter the proposal. That includes Hong Kong’s most influential business group, the American Chamber of Commerce, which said it could sweep business people into China’s legal orbit. Taipei officials say they will not sign any agreement that implies Taiwan is part of China.Margaret Ng, a former lawmaker, addressed the crowd at the end of the route. “People from all the world must support Hong Kong,” she said once off the stage. “It’s the freest city in China … If they pass it, it will be very difficult to see Hong Kong as a different place from China.”Source: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/28/hong-kong-residents-protest-at-plans-for-extradition-to-china",1

On June 16, Hong Kong was brought to a standstill for the second time in two weeks by a mass protest that drew reportedly two million people to the streets over a proposed amendment to an existing bill. If you're feeling a little out of the loop and struggling to understand what all the fuss is about, let us give you a little crash course on what exactly is going in Hong Kong right now.",1

Chan disposed of the body by putting it in a suitcase and left it in the bushes before fleeing back to Hong Kong. Chan was eventually arrested and confessed to the crime when Poon’s body was found, yet Hong Kong authorities can only charge him with money laundering for using his girlfriend's credit cards. He was sentenced to 29 months in jail, as opposed to a life sentence for murder.",3

Since the crime wasn’t committed on Hong Kong soil, Hong Kong courts have no legal grounds to sentence Chan to prison for murder.

This brings us to the current protests…",1
4811,35625,"What are the protests about?Chan’s situation highlighted a gap in local extradition laws. As a way to resolve it, the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the city’s existing law, allowing local and foreign criminal suspects in Hong Kong (including visitors) to be extradited to other jurisdictions – including mainland China – without legislative oversight. By doing so, Hong Kong can safely extradite Chan and any possible future fugitives out of our city. But things get a bit more complicated from here.",1

On June 16, Hong Kong was brought to a standstill for the second time in two weeks by a mass protest that drew reportedly two million people to the streets over a proposed amendment to an existing bill. If you're feeling a little out of the loop and struggling to understand what all the fuss is about, let us give you a little crash course on what exactly is going in Hong Kong right now.",2
4992,36725,"How did it all start?In February 2018, a Hong Kong citizen Chan Tong-kai strangled his pregnant girlfriend, Poon Hiu-wing, during a trip to Taiwan. Chan disposed of the body by putting it in a suitcase and left it in the bushes before fleeing back to Hong Kong. Chan was eventually arrested and confessed to the crime when Poon’s body was found, yet Hong Kong authorities can only charge him with money laundering for using his girlfriend's credit cards. He was sentenced to 29 months in jail, as opposed to a life sentence for murder.",3
4993,36726,"This case is a complicated one for both Hong Kong and Taiwan. Since the crime wasn’t committed on Hong Kong soil, Hong Kong courts have no legal grounds to sentence Chan to prison for murder. The usual procedures for such cases would be to send the criminal back to the country where the crime was committed, but as our city doesn't share an extradition agreement with Taiwan, Hong Kong authorities’ hands are tied. This brings us to the current protests…",2
4994,36727,"What are the protests about?Chan’s situation highlighted a gap in local extradition laws. As a way to resolve it, the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the city’s existing law, allowing local and foreign criminal suspects in Hong Kong (including visitors) to be extradited to other jurisdictions – including mainland China – without legislative oversight. By doing so, Hong Kong can safely extradite Chan and any possible future fugitives out of our city. But things get a bit more complicated from here.",2
4995,36728,"The main issue is that mainland China doesn't exactly have the best track record when it comes to human rights. Many Hongkongers are concerned that the Chinese central government could use the new amendment as a tool to snap up democracy advocates, dissidents and other political opponents of the country. The proposed bill sparked outrage across the city, leading to mass protests over the course of two weeks that saw Hong Kong police using arguably excessive force, injured students and protestors arrested at the hospital on the grounds of rioting, and a man falling to his death in Admiralty on June 15.",2

In response to those demands, Lam has reiterated that the extradition bill is suspended until the government regains the people’s trust. Lam also said that it’s 'very unlikely' for the bill to be passed before the LegCo term ends next year. Regarding calls for her resignation, Lam has said she intends to remain in office and has asked for citizens to give her a second chance to rebuild people’s trust in the government The chief executive has also turned down the suggestion to set up an independent commission to look into police actions at the June 12 protest, adding that 'existing mechanisms' must be used.",1

5146,39241,"In the recent decision of HKSAR v Yeung Ka Sing Carson (FACC Nos. 5 & 6 of 2015), the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal held that, on a charge under s 25(1) of the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) (‘OSCO’), the prosecution does not need to demonstrate that the proceeds being dealt with by the defendant were proceeds of an indictable offence. It will be sufficient for the prosecution to show that there were reasonable grounds for the defendant to believe that the proceeds he/she dealt with were proceeds of an indictable offence. This clarification by the Court not only establishes a wide scope for an offence to be made out but also draws attention to the structural differences between money laundering offences in Hong Kong and those in the UK.

The prosecution opted not to establish any of the predicate offences that the monies were alleged to have originated from, and argued that there were reasonable grounds for Mr Yeung to believe that the property in question represented the proceeds of an indictable offence. Among the issues that the Court of Final Appeal was tasked with deciding was whether the prosecution is required to establish that the property being dealt with by the defendant was indeed proceeds of an indictable offence.",3
5149,39244,"This issue had already been dealt with by the Appeal Committee in HKSAR Wong Ping Shui (2001) 4 HKCFAR 29. It was held that the feature of the property representing the proceeds of an indictable offence is an element in the mens rea and not the actus reus, since s 25(1) OSCO defines the actus reus as dealing with property that the defendant knows or has reasonable grounds to believe represents proceeds of an indictable offence. This interpretation was affirmed in Oei Hengky Wiryo v HKSAR (No 2) (2007) 10 HKCFAR 98 after the Court of Final Appeal took into consideration the decision of the House of Lords in R v Montilla [2004] 1 WLR 3141, in which a contrary view was adopted regarding the old UK offences set out in s 93C(2) of the Criminal Justice Act (‘CJA’) 1988 and s 49(2) of the Drug Trafficking Act (‘DTA’) 1994. The Oei Hengky Wiryo decision was subsequently affirmed in HKSAR v Li Kwok Cheung George (2014) 17 HKCFAR 319. However, Counsel on behalf of Mr Yeung argued that Oei Hengky Wiryo was wrongly decided and adopted the approach decided in Montila. Counsel contended that the words ‘that property’ at the end of s 25(1) referred to the immediately preceding phrase ‘any person’s proceeds of an indictable offence’. Thus, semantically, the actus reus should be interpreted as requiring the property dealt with by the defendant to indeed be proceeds of an indictable offence.",1
5150,39245,"In rejecting this argument, the Court held that the words ‘that property’ referred to the same ‘property’ that was used earlier in the section in relation to the mens rea requirement – the property that the defendant had reasonable grounds to believe are the proceeds of an indictable offence. The mens rea requirement will be satisfied if it can be demonstrated that the defendant knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that any property represents the proceeds of an indictable offence, whether in whole or in part; and the actus reus is committed when that property is dealt with by the defendant. Indeed, their Lordships opined that:",1
5151,39246,"…the fact that the present offence is defined as dealing with “any property” rather than dealing with “the proceeds of an indictable offence”, strongly indicates that the statutory intention is to avoid imposing any requirement of proof that the property dealt with actually represents the proceeds of indictable crime.[1]",1
5152,39247,"Their Lordships indicated that there is a ‘major structural difference’ between the offence in OSCO s 25(1) and the old UK offences in DTA 1994 s 49(2) and CJA 1988 s 93C(2). [2] A defendant used to fall foul of an offence under the DTA or CJA where he (a) concealed or disguised the property; (b) or converted or transferred or removed it from the jurisdiction, for the purposes of assisting any person to avoid prosecution for a drug trafficking offence or a CJA 1988 offence or the making or enforcement of a confiscation order. The effect of this formulation necessitates the property in question to in fact be the proceeds of crime. It must be demonstrated that the property was handled for the purposes stated, requiring a level of knowledge from the defendant that borders on actual knowledge that the property is in fact proceeds of crime. Instead of merely proving that the defendant ‘dealt’ with the property, the prosecution must also show that the defendant had committed one of the aforementioned acts of concealing, disguising, converting, transferring or removing.",1
5153,39248,"However, the policy reasons behind the approach in Hong Kong are compelling. Underlying offences that the property in question allegedly relates to are notoriously difficult to prove since such offences may have been committed in multiple jurisdictions, and the proceeds of these offences may have been put through a multitude of sanitising processes which make the task of tracing the origins of such property formidable. The current approach enables more effective prosecution of money laundering by side-stepping the obstacle of having to establish predicate offences. This means that, potentially, the scope of the money laundering offences in Hong Kong are much wider than in the UK, where the proof of the existence of criminal property remains a vital constituent element of the offences contrary to sections 327 to 329 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. It follows that British businessmen in Hong Kong need to exercise particular caution when handling property in Hong Kong in circumstances that may give rise to a suspicion that the property being dealt with are proceeds of an indictable offence.

When these AML offences first came onto the statute book in Hong Kong a generation ago it was the “failing to report” offence that appeared to have financial intermediaries and the professions more worried than the more serious “dealing” offence. However, prosecutions for “failing to report” pursuant to s. 25A of OSCO are rare; perhaps, in part, reflecting its summary offence status. The police and the prosecution authorities appear to be content to let things be (for now). In the meantime, a high level of “defensive reporting” appears to continue.",1

We reported on this in November 2014. In April 2015 we reported on the case of Salim Majid where the question of duplicity in money-laundering charges is to be considered by the Court of Final Appeal. The question of duplicity in money laundering charges has again arisen in the appeal of the former Birmingham City Football Football Club President, Carson Yeung Ka Sing. The Prosecution has been granted leave to appeal on the following questions:",3
5187,39282,"(1) “In the context of the offence of money laundering under section 25 of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455 (‘the Ordinance’), how does the rule against duplicity operate? In particular, whether the offence of money laundering, capable of being committed in any of the modes of ‘dealing’ as included in its definition under section 2 of the Ordinance, is or could be a continuing offence so that the rule against duplicity does not apply; and how do the exceptions to the rule against duplicity (namely, ‘one transaction’ as in DPP v Merriman [1973] AC 584, ‘general deficiency’ as in R v Tomlin [1954] 2 QB 274 and ‘continuous course of conduct’ as in Barton v DPP [2001] 165 JP 779) apply to a charge of money laundering which alleges multiple dealings some of which involve money from known and different sources?”",3

Under what circumstances should the trial judge apply these two formulations?”",1
5189,39284,"(1) “On a charge of dealing with proceeds of crime contrary to s.25 (1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) (“OSCO”), is it necessary for the prosecution to prove, as an element of the offence, that the proceeds being dealt with were in fact proceeds of an indictable offence? Was Oei Hengky Wiryo (2007) 10 HKCFAR 98 wrongly decided on this issue?”",1

In particular, where the trial judge rejects the defendant’s testimony, to what extent can the judge remain oblivious to the defendant’s actual reason(s) for dealing with the specified proceeds in making the finding that the defendant had reasonable grounds to believe that the proceeds he dealt with were proceeds of crime?”",1
5191,39286,"Since the Oei Hengky Wiryo decision in 2007, prosecutors (unlike in England and Wales) do not have to prove that the money handled in a money laundering trial is, in fact, the proceeds of crime, and it has not been necessary to establish the predicate offence.

However, despite meaningful differences between the two legislative regimes, the issue is be revisited in an upcoming appeal in Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal, HKSAR v Yeung Ka Sing Carson.",3
5336,40313,"Money laundering law in Hong Kong is unsettled since Carson Yeung, the former president of Birmingham City Football Club, was granted leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal (“the CFA”) in August 2015 on a point of legal importance. The hearing is set for May 2016.",3
5337,40314,"Yeung’s appeal relates to his conviction in the District Court on five counts of dealing with property known or believed to represent the proceeds of an indictable offence, contrary to s.25 (1) Organized and Serious Crime Ordinance (Cap. 455). At trial, the Prosecution case was that movement of funds in Yeung’s five bank accounts bore the hallmarks of money laundering.",3
5338,40315,"One of the questions which have been certified for appeal is whether the Prosecution must prove that the proceeds that were dealt with were in fact the proceeds of an indictable offence, or in other words, “criminal property”. Up until now, the elements of the offence under s.25 (1) Organized and Serious Crime Ordinance (Cap. 455) were thought to be settled.",1
5339,40316,"In HKSAR v Wong Ping Shui & Another (2001) 4 HKCFAR 29, the applicant for leave to appeal raised a technical argument, comparing the status of “property” in the context of an offence of s.25 (1) Organized and Serious Crime Ordinance (Cap. 455) to that of “property” in the context of an offence of handling stolen goods under s.24 (1) Theft Ordinance (Cap. 210). Refusing leave, Ribeiro PJ, on behalf of the Court, considered that based on the natural meaning of the words in s.25 (1), “dealing with property” was the actus reus required to be proved by the Prosecution, not “dealing with the proceeds of an indictable offence.” The status of the “property”, namely the belief or knowledge that it was such proceeds, was the mens rea. By contrast, the status of “stolen goods” formed both actus reus and mens rea. As a consequence, the Prosecution did not have to prove that the property was in fact the proceeds of an indictable offence for an offence of money laundering under s.25 (1) to be established.",3
5340,40317,"In the United Kingdom the opposite view has been taken. Similar legislation was considered by the House of Lords in Regina v Montila and others [2004] UKHL 50; [2004] 1 WLR 3141, which held that the fact that the property in question had its origins in criminal conduct or drug trafficking was an essential part of the actus reus of the offences of money laundering. The legislative provisions which arose for consideration in that case were section 93C (2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and section 49 (2) of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994.",3
5341,40318,"In the lead judgment on behalf of the Committee of the House of Lords, Lord Hope had regard to the United Nation Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, which was adopted in Vienna in 1988 and the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990, which was subsequently enacted in the United Kingdom to implement the Convention. Noting that the purpose of the Convention was to combat the vicious cycle of drug trafficking and funding through proceeds laundering, Lord Hope considered that the Prosecution had to prove that the proceeds were in fact “criminal property” for offences of money laundering to be established.",1
5342,40319,"In view of the outcome in Montila, the point was revisited in Hong Kong by the CFA in Hengky Wiryo v HKSAR (No2) [2007] 1 HKLRD 568. However, five judges of the CFA unanimously held that there were no grounds to conclude Wong was wrongly decided.",1
5343,40320,"In Hong Kong, the natural and ordinary meaning of s.25 (1) defines the offence of money laundering as dealing with “property” which the defendant “knows or has reasonable grounds to believe represent proceeds of an indictable offence,” not “dealing with the proceeds of an indictable offence”. This is in “sharp contrast” to the language of the money laundering legislative provisions which were the subject of consideration in Montila (paragraph [100]). Accordingly, affirming Wong, the CFA held that “dealing with property” was the actus reus, whereas the status of the property was the mens rea.",1
5344,40321,"This is not to say that Montila should not be considered in Hong Kong. Where the Prosecution relies on the “knowing” limb of s.25 (1), it will have to prove that the property being dealt with is in fact the proceeds of an indictable offence. In this regard, the comments of Lord Hope in Montila at paragraph [27]), that “the proposition that a person knows that something is A is based on the premise that it is true that it is A. The fact that the property is A provides the starting point. Then there is the question whether the person knows that the property is A,” are pertinent.",1
5345,40322,"However, if the Prosecution relies on the “reasonable grounds to believe” limb of s.25b (1), requiring the Prosecution to also prove that the property was in fact the proceeds of an indictable offence conflates the mens rea and actus reus. In essence, it creates an additional evidentiary hurdle for the Prosecution that is not required by s. 25(1).",1
5346,40323,"Although the strength of the Prosecution case might well be questionable if the Prosecution is unable to prove that the property was in fact proceeds of an indictable offence, there are clear differences between the law of money laundering in the United Kingdom and in Hong Kong. Others include a defence to money laundering of “reasonable excuse” in s. 25(2) which is not available in the United Kingdom. Further, rather than the threshold for a money laundering offence being “reasonable grounds to suspect” criminal property, as it is in the United Kingdom, s. 25 (1) requires the Prosecution in Hong Kong to prove a higher standard of “reasonable grounds to believe”. These subtle but meaningful differences reinforce that the English approach may not be readily applicable in Hong Kong.",1

5395,40372,"Much has already been written about the Court of Appeal's landmark judgment in Citic Pacific Ltd v Secretary for Justice (No 2), including in the Hong Kong Lawyer*. That judgment is now reported ([2015] 4 HKLRD 20) and, at the time of writing, no appeal appears to be in sight. As a result, legal advice privilege has been put on a more expansive footing; for example, a restrictive view of a corporate client in this context has been specifically disavowed. A confidential communication brought into existence with the dominant purpose that it or its contents be used for the purpose of obtaining legal advice is privileged.",1
5396,40373,"While claims to litigation privilege are considered on a case by case basis, it would be fair to state that the general trend has been more restrictive. Of late, claims to litigation privilege has been subject to closer scrutiny by common law courts and matters have become more complicated (particularly, in a regulatory context).",1
5397,40374,"A ""dominant purpose"" test also applies in the context of litigation privilege. Under Hong Kong common law, litigation privilege protects confidential documents that are created: (i) between a lawyer and a client or a client and third party or a lawyer and third party; (ii) at a time when litigation exists or is reasonably anticipated; and (iii) for the ""dominant purpose"" of obtaining legal advice, evidence or information for that litigation.",1
5398,40375,"Hong Kong common law applies general English common law principles in this regard. In a trend of recent English cases during the past few years claims to litigation privilege have been found wanting. Such cases include: Hallows v Wilson Barca LLP [2015] Chancery Division (unreported), 10 September 2015 (pre-planning advice obtained from a local planning authority); Rawlinson and Hunter Trustees SA & Ors v Akers & Anor [2014] EWCA Civ 136 (accountants' reports prepared for a liquidator); and Starbev Gp Ltd v Interbrew Central European Holding BV [2013] EWHC 4038 (separate reports prepared by a bank and a firm of accountants following the sale of the defendant's business to the claimant).",1
5399,40376,"At the risk of oversimplification, litigation privilege protects ""evidence gathering"" with respect to contentious proceedings. With that in mind, when a lawyer or client communicates with a third party in connection with a matter that is or may become contentious, it is important to record at the outset that the main purpose of the communication is to obtain information for that matter. Of course, if the person from whom the information is sought is concerned for their own position, this could run the risk that they may not cooperate.",1
5400,40377,"Practitioners and academics would do well to stay abreast of these developments. Both types of legal professional privilege are not mutually exclusive. However, they are (for now) distinct and following different trends.

5459,40486,"There are increasingly aggressive efforts by regulators and now by the judiciary in Hong Kong in combating money laundering. The recent judgment of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (“CFA“) in HKSAR v Yeung Ka Sing Carson1 (“Carson Yeung Appeal“) serves as a timely reminder of the potential substantial risks in failed AML efforts. The CFA has confirmed, among other things, that on a charge of dealing with proceeds of crime contrary to s 25 (1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (“OSCO”), the prosecution only needs to show that when an accused dealt with certain property, he or she knew, or had reasonable grounds to believe that such property represented the proceeds of an indictable offence. The property does not need to be actual proceeds of crime. It is said by the CFA that there are strong policy reasons favouring this conclusion. This alert will discuss the Carson Yeung Appeal and what clients can do when faced with suspicious transactions.",1
5460,40487,"The Carson Yeung Appeal has important implications for clients who are handling and transferring funds. The prosecution will not need to prove that the property being dealt with was in fact the proceeds of an indictable offence (i.e. tainted assets). As the mental element of the offence is either knowing or having reasonable grounds of belief, actual knowledge is not required. If there are circumstances which may impose a suspicion or reasonable belief (that the relevant property is tainted), this means caution has to be exercised before dealing with it.",1
5461,40488,"By way of background, in 2011, the former Birmingham City Football Club chairman Carson Yeung (“Yeung“) was convicted in the District Court on five counts of dealing with property believed to be proceeds of an indictable offence for laundering more than HKD700 million in Hong Kong. The District Court heard various parties including securities firms, which made more than 900 deposits into the accounts in question between 2001 and 2007. The court ruled that Yeung dealt with those deposits and found that he knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that those funds were the proceeds of an indictable offence. On 11 July 2016, the CFA dismissed Yeung’s appeal. The following are some of the key points in the CFA decision.",3
5462,40489,"The CFA confirmed that the legislation no longer requires proof that the property dealt under section 25(1) consists of the actual proceeds of an indictable offence.

5465,40492,"The Court endorsed its earlier decision in HKSAR v Pang Hung Fai (2014) that the prosecution needs to prove that the accused “had grounds for believing, and the grounds must be reasonable, that anyone looking at those grounds objectively would so believe.” This involves an examination of the accused’s state of mind in two aspects.

5476,40503,"In so doing, the CFA held that the phrase “transaction involving securities” in s.300 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) is to be given a wide meaning, which is not confined to a single arrangement, and can also include a series of inter-related but discrete steps, such as purchases or sales of Taiwan listed Hsinchu Bank shares through the misuse of confidential insider information regarding the takeover plan of Standard Chartered Bank (SCB). In addition, the CFA held that insider dealing of overseas listed securities (excluding Hong Kong listed securities which will be caught and dealt with by the usual insider dealing provisions in the SFO) will be caught by s.300 of the SFO, provided “substantial activities constituting the crime” occurred within Hong Kong.",2
5477,40504,"As per our earlier newsletters, in this case, Betty (the 1st Defendant) was a solicitor seconded to SCB by her then employer in respect of SCB’s takeover of Hsinchu Bank. During the secondment, she obtained inside information about SCB’s intended tender offer for Hsinchu Bank shares. Based on the inside information, Betty and Eric (the 2nd Defendant, a solicitor, and Betty’s friend) through Patsy (the 3rd Defendant, Eric’s sister) acquired shares in Hsinchu Bank. Patsy also invested for Stella (the 4th Defendant, Eric’s sister). All of them made profits as a result.",2
5478,40505,The SFC relied on s.300 instead of the insider dealing provision under s.291 of the SFO because Hsinchu Bank shares were overseas listed shares which are not covered by s.291. The SFC sought a declaration that s.300 was contravened in order for the Court to make remedial and disgorgement orders under s.213 against the Defendants.,1
5479,40506,"The Court of First Instance (whose judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal) found that the Defendants contravened s.300 by practising fraud and deception in transactions involving securities, and made disgorgement orders against them.",3
5480,40507,"(a) First, that the words “a person shall not directly or indirectly, in a transaction involving securities” must be read to require that “person” – i.e. the defendant – to be a party to the “transaction” referred to.",1
5481,40508,"(b) Secondly, that, since the only transactions that the Defendants (meaning Patsy and, through her as their agent, Eric, Betty and Stella) entered into were the contracts to purchase the Hsinchu Bank shares and then to sell them to SCB in accepting SCB’s Tender Offer, the relevant transactions in the present case were those share dealing transactions, i.e. the purchase and then the sale of the shares, taken as separate transactions.",1
5482,40509,"(c) Thirdly, that the fraud or deception also had to be “in the transaction”, meaning, they had to be practised by the defendant on the counterparty to the relevant transaction. There transactions did not involve any fraud or deception practised on their counterparties.",1
5483,40510,"The Defendants argued that the fraud or deception must be practiced on a counterparty to the transaction before it can be regarded as being “in a transaction”. The deception practised against SCB was not employed or engaged in the transaction involving the purchase of Hsinchu Bank shares over the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The analogy was that if a person steals money to buy shares on an exchange, the fraud constituted by the theft is not a fraud in the securities transaction.",2
5484,40511,"The CFA opined that s.300 of the SFO did not require the Defendants to be party to the transactions or that fraud must be practised on the counterparty, so long as their fraudulent or deceptive scheme is employed in connection with or in relation to the transaction. In any event, the CFA agreed with the Courts below that fraud was practiced on SCB both in respect of the misuse of the inside information and the tender of the shares to SCB.",3
5485,40512,"Mr. Justice Spigelman NPJ also reviewed the legislative history of the Ordinance and found that reference to a counterparty (“transaction with any other person” in the predecessor provision) was removed when s.300 became law. The Defendants’ arguments were writing back into the section the words which the legislature removed, which is not permissible.",0
5486,40513,"The Defendants argued that the purchase of the shares was a transaction and their sale when the tender was accepted was a separate transaction, and that it would strain the natural meaning of the word to cover preparatory steps antecedent to the dealing in securities such as the use or disclosure of the inside information, or the deposit of money into the trading account that was used to purchase the shares in question.",1
5487,40514,The CFA held that it is artificial to split the purchase and sale into two or more separate transactions. The word must be given a meaning that is required by the context of the section and such as would achieve its purpose. The word “transaction” has a wide meaning. The CFA referred to HKSAR v Yeung Ka Sing Carson (2016) 19 HKCFAR 279 in which the CFA said at paragraph 137 that “[i]n making a judgment as to whether acts are so connected that they can fairly be regarded as forming part of the same transaction or criminal enterprise it is necessary to keep in mind the purpose for which the question is asked.”,1
5488,40515,Mr. Justice Ribeiro PJ opined that the Defendants’ scheme fell comfortably within s.300. The relevant “transaction involving securities” encompassed the misuse and disclosure of inside information regarding SCB’s takeover; misuse of that information by purchasing the Hsinchu Bank shares with a view to selling them to SCB at a higher tender price; their acceptance of SCB’s offer and their realisation of larger profits derived from their misuse of the inside information. These dealings formed a part of the overall transaction.,1
5489,40516,"Mr. Justice Spigelman NPJ opined that “transaction” is not a word that can be confined to a single arrangement and it may and frequently does include a series of occurrences extending over a length of time. His Lordship said that conduct can involve “securities” and have occurred “in a transaction” if the events said to constitute the transaction consist of a series of inter-related, but discrete steps.",1
5490,40517,"The CFA held that “securities” under s.300 is not confined to shares listed in Hong Kong. It would be in line with the purpose of the Ordinance and Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre that s.300 should cover insider dealing in shares listed in Taiwan, if substantial activities constituting the crime occurred within Hong Kong. However, to avoid s.300 also applying to the insider dealing of Hong Kong listed shares, the CFA said that s.300 excludes such insider dealing, which will be dealt with by the usual insider dealing provisions.",1
5491,40518,"The CFA’s judgment is to be welcomed. The CFA said that it would be in keeping with the purpose of the SFO and Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre that provided substantial activities constituting the crime occurred in Hong Kong, s.300 should cover the insider dealing in shares listed overseas. It now confirms that notwithstanding that the shares are not Hong Kong listed, insider dealing of overseas listed securities is caught by s.300 of the SFO.

In April 2015 we reported on the case of Salim Majid where the question of duplicity in money-laundering charges is to be considered by the Court of Final Appeal. The question of duplicity in money laundering charges has again arisen in the appeal of the former Birmingham City Football Football Club President, Carson Yeung Ka Sing. The Prosecution has been granted leave to appeal on the following questions:",3

In particular, whether the offence of money laundering, capable of being committed in any of the modes of ‘dealing’ as included in its definition under section 2 of the Ordinance, is or could be a continuing offence so that the rule against duplicity does not apply; and how do the exceptions to the rule against duplicity (namely, ‘one transaction’ as in DPP v Merriman [1973] AC 584, ‘general deficiency’ as in R v Tomlin [1954] 2 QB 274 and ‘continuous course of conduct’ as in Barton v DPP [2001] 165 JP 779) apply to a charge of money laundering which alleges multiple dealings some of which involve money from known and different sources?”",1

5523,40550,"(1) “On a charge of dealing with proceeds of crime contrary to s.25 (1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) (“OSCO”), is it necessary for the prosecution to prove, as an element of the offence, that the proceeds being dealt with were in fact proceeds of an indictable offence?

In particular, where the trial judge rejects the defendant’s testimony, to what extent can the judge remain oblivious to the defendant’s actual reason(s) for dealing with the specified proceeds in making the finding that the defendant had reasonable grounds to believe that the proceeds he dealt with were proceeds of crime?”",1

5604,38938,"In particular, the decision in HKSAR v Yeung Ka Sing Carson[2] (Yeung Case) reinforces that “reasonable grounds” should take into account the personal beliefs, perceptions and prejudices of the person involved.

5606,38940,"This alert describes the key facts and takeaways from the Yeung Case, together with our comments on some open questions – particularly for financial institutions and other large corporates - that continue to make identifying suspicion a challenging topic.",1
5607,38941,"Carson Yeung, a prominent Hong Kong businessman and ultimate owner of Birmingham City F.C., deposited over HKD271 million into five separate accounts through over 900 individual deposits between 2001 and 2007. Yeung alleged that the money had legitimate sources, including his casino winnings, share earnings and return on investments. He was charged with five counts of money laundering under section 25(1) of the OSCO.",3
5608,38942,Section 25(1) of the OSCO makes it an offence for a person to deal with any property while knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that the property represents any persons’ proceeds of an indictable offence. The essence of Yeung’s defence was that the funds could not represent the proceeds of an indictable offence as he had reasonable grounds to believe it came from legitimate sources.,1
5609,38943,"Yeung was convicted of the five charges in the District Court and sentenced to a total of six years’ imprisonment. The Court did not believe Yeung’s explanation of the source of the money, and it was found that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the money was the proceeds of crime.",3
5610,38944,"Briefly, in that case, Pang, the accused, allowed two strangers’ cheques worth HKD14 million to be deposited into his accounts and remitted abroad at the request of Kwok, a close friend. Those funds were the proceeds of a fraud committed by Kwok, and Pang was convicted of money laundering at first instance. Unlike in the Yeung Case, the CFA quashed Pang’s conviction for money laundering on appeal.",2
5611,38945,"The CFA found that, although others might have been suspicious of the transaction, the District Court had failed to take into account the fact that Pang himself trusted Kwok due to a long personal and business relationship, and that Pang thought of Kwok as a wealthy businessman with factories significantly larger than his own, being unaware of Kwok’s financial difficulties. In determining what a reasonable person would have believed, the CFA found that the District Court should have taken these factors into its consideration. The CFA therefore overturned Pang’s conviction.",2
5612,38946,"the state of mind of the accused can serve as evidence that Limb 1 of the test was not satisfied – that is, to demonstrate that they had no grounds for believing the property represented the proceeds to crime.",1
5613,38947,"However, here, Yeung’s testimony that the funds had legitimate sources was not believed at trial. Accordingly, the CFA found that there was no credible evidence that Yeung’s state of mind negated the existence of grounds for believing the funds were the proceeds of crime. Consequently, the CFA held that the requisite reasonable grounds were made out on the evidence presented by the prosecution - effectively, he should have known or suspected something was awry.",3
5614,38948,"For example, where the conduct in question involves a number of transactions over a long period, with large sums being transferred, it may be difficult for a person to explain why they had no reasonable grounds for suspicion. The Pang Case involved two linked transactions conducted at a friend’s behest. In contrast, the Yeung case involved a large number of transactions spanning several years, with a far larger overall sum.",3
5615,38949,"The CFA also confirmed the finding in a 2007 CFA decision[4] that it is not necessary to prove that the property with which the accused dealt in actual fact represents the proceeds of an indictable offence. Section 25(1) of the OSCO merely requires the accused deal with the relevant property, with a clear statutory intention to avoid imposing any requirement to show that the property actually represents the proceeds of crime.",3
5616,38950,"Finally, the CFA addressed the application of the rule against duplicity to money laundering offences. In summary, the rule against duplicity requires that a count in indictment must set out only one offence, and not more than one. The rule is recognised in the Indictment Rules (Cap. 211C).",1
5617,38951,"The CFA confirmed that in the money laundering context, where a number of acts associated with money laundering are connected in such a way that they can be regarded as forming part of the same transaction, then they can be charged in a single count unless there is some risk of injustice. The CFA subsequently found that the transactions in the Yeung Case could be aggregated due to the multiplicity of acts alleged and the common purpose of concealment.",3
5618,38952,"The Yeung Case clarifies important principles relating to the subjective elements of the money laundering offence. However, it also demonstrates that every case is unique and must be considered on its own facts. Where the prosecution is able to show clear indicia of money laundering, and the facts are difficult to explain, this can provide an insurmountable hurdle for the accused. That is, it may be difficult for the court to believe an explanation from the accused as to why they did not have reasonable grounds to believe that property represents the proceeds of crime.",1

5620,38954,"For organisations, particularly large multinationals, the Yeung Case emphasises the need for a sophisticated approach to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing controls.

That is, how proximate does money or other property need to be to the crime to remain ""dirty""? How long before they have been successfully “cleansed” and integrated? One important point to remember here is that the OSCO refers to any property that “in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person’s proceeds of an indictable offence”.",1
5623,38957,"When does a legal entity know or suspect something? The principles relating to the attribution of knowledge for corporations are very complex, particularly for large organisations. They can also vary from one jurisdiction to another and be especially challenging in the context of outsourced activities. For example, if a trade processor sitting in India comes across something suspicious in an invoice, when will this suspicion be attributed to the bank for which they are processing the trade? What is buried in transaction records that a financial institution should have picked up?",1
5624,38958,"Where is knowledge or suspicion relevant? For example, if a money laundering reporting officer (MLRO) or senior supervisor sitting in another country becomes aware of a matter, does that trigger a suspicious reporting obligation in that other country?

He was said to have dealt with more than HK$720 million in five different bank accounts between 2001 and 2007. At the trial, the prosecution did not seek to prove that the monies were actual proceeds of crime.

Hence, it was the interpretation of the movement of the funds and the reason behind the movements that was in issue.

5765,40032,"Prosecution Case It was the prosecution’s case that, firstly, deposits could not have been from the sources of income declared by Yeung and his father in their tax documents.

He gave evidence that the salon businesses collectively generated an annual income of approximately HK$10 million. However, when the Court compared Yeung’s evidence with the relevant tax returns, the Court found that Yeung exaggerated the income he earned from his salon businesses.",3
5771,40038,"Securities Dealings In relation to Yeung’s securities dealings, Yeung tried to make out the scenario that because he was operating so many brokerage accounts, he would need to settle the margin calls quickly so as not to incur any losses from forced sale of his shares. Hence, the quickest way was to deposit cash directly into the brokerage firm’s bank accounts.",1
5772,40039,"However, according to various securities firm employees, a cash deposit would at most be just half a day or a day faster than a bank transfer. The Court found that there was no good reason for Yeung to use cash to settle the margins. The Court also found that one of the reasons Yeung chose to use cash to deal with securities companies was that Yeung knew cash transactions are more difficult to be traced.",3
5773,40040,"Winnings from Casino For the deposits from SJM, the Court observed that there were 10 cash cheques issued to Yeung within a narrow period of time. While Yeung claimed that he won most of the time, he could not explain why only 10 cheques were issued to him. If they really represented winnings from gambling, it must have been a memorable win for Yeung. Yet Yeung claimed he was not able to remember any details of how he requested the money or the circumstances that he had won so much money. In the end, the Court found that Yeung was lying when he said that the said deposits from SJM were all moneys from his gambling winnings.",3
5774,40041,"Returns of Investment In relation to the various deposits from third parties, Yeung sought to explain that a large portion of the said deposits were returns from his investments in shares of Gold Wo, Neptune Club and Stock Code 070.",1
5775,40042,"Gold Wo Transactions Yeung alleged that he was able to secure an off-market purchase of Gold Wo’s shares at a big discount and subsequently sell the shares through a Ms. Yu to various purchasers. However, there were no documents to even hint at the existence of such an arrangement, which the Court found extremely strange as the sum of money involved was huge by any account.",3
5776,40043,"Stock Code 070 Yeung’s story was that he acquired 20% of the said shares by investing HK$26.4 million with Lin Cheuk Fung and Cheung Chi Tai who were respectively the majority and second largest shareholder. However, Yeung was not the registered holder of the shares, but merely held the beneficial interest in the shares, and Lin Cheuk Fung continued to appear as the majority shareholder on paper. Yeung said he was receiving 100% per annum interest from his investment, which Cheung Chi Tai paid into his account.",3

The Court further found that Yeung, someone with extensive experience in dealing with shares, must have known that the behind the scene transactions without disclosure about his interest was inappropriate at least and illegal at worst.",3
5778,40045,"Neptune Club The evidence showed a total deposit of approximately HK$5 million to Yeung and his father through various third parties (supposedly on Lin Cheuk Fung’s behalf), which Yeung alleged were returns from his HK$20 million investment in Neptune Club.",1
5779,40046,"However, the Court held that Yeung was not telling the truth. The investment was supposed to have been made in “early 2005” yet by April and May Yeung and his father were already being repaid HK$5 million. The transaction did not make sense. The Court further held that even if Yeung was telling the truth and even if he did not consider there was any problem with the payments being made by third parties on behalf of Lin Cheuk Fung (boss of Neptune Club) instead of by Lin’s company or Lin himself, given that Yeung was dealing with a boss of a casino in Macau, any right thinking member of the community would consider such method of payment to be reasonable ground to believe that those money represented proceeds of an indictable offence.",3
5780,40047,"Further, the deposits were not small amounts: any right thinking person would pause and wonder why the majority shareholder of a listed company would be repaying investment returns in the listed company by way of cheques drawn on third parties’ personal or company account. The Court found that the same right thinking person would immediately have decided that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the money so deposited into the defendant’s and his father’s bank account represented wholly or in part, directly or indirectly proceeds of an indictable offence.",3

Hence Yeung was held as having reasonable grounds to so believe and was convicted of all 5 charges. Yeung was sentenced to a total of 6 years imprisonment.

In particular, whether the offence of money laundering, capable of being committed in any of the modes of ‘dealing’ as included in its definition under section 2 of the Ordinance, is or could be a continuing offence so that the rule against duplicity does not apply; and how do the exceptions to the rule against duplicity (namely, ‘one transaction’ as in DPP v Merriman [1973] AC 584, ‘general deficiency’ as in R v Tomlin [1954] 2 QB 274 and ‘continuous course of conduct’ as in Barton v DPP [2001] 165 JP 779) apply to a charge of money laundering which alleges multiple dealings some of which involve money from known and different sources?”",1

Drawing on the notion of fit theory together with moderation contingent logic, this study investigates the effects of international performance and internal strategic fit as well as the moderating impact of cultural distance and international experience on the firm's exit decision. The results indicate that strategic misfit and poor international performance have a detrimental effect on the firm's survival in the foreign market. Furthermore, the results suggest that cultural distance moderates the impact of the internal strategic fit and international performance on the exit decision. In addition, the authors find a significant three-way interaction between international performance, cultural distance, and international experience.

The Financial Action Task Force (created in 1989 by the seven major industrial ... [Show full abstract] nations and the President of the European Commission) estimated that the amount of money being laundered through the financial system was US$85bn per year. The extent of the problem was recognised in the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report for 1993 which found that eight of the world's major money laundering states are located in Europe. Europe has responded to the growing crisis in the financial sector with the Money Laundering Directive which was due to be fully implemented across the Community by 1st January, 1993. The Directive which applies to credit institutions and financial institutions, including community based branches of non‐Community institutions, reflects a number of key international initiatives and attempts to harmonise the anti‐money laundering legislation of the member states, though with varied success. This paper reviews developments within the UK since the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 which marked the beginning of the Governments campaign to deprive criminals of the fruits of their crime and which has culminated in parts I to IV of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 (CJA 1993), which received Royal Assent on 27th July, 1993. The key money laundering provisions of the CJA 1993 have been introduced piecemeal, but have all been in force since 1st April, 1994.

The influences of physical and geometrical properties of both the starch were evaluated with regards to their compression ... [Show full abstract] properties. It has been found that Assam Bora rice starch reflects better physical characteristics such as higher bulk and tap densities, less porosity, better powder packing ability, minimum lubricant sensitivity, large surface area and improved flowability. Apart from that the mechanical properties, such as toughness and Young's modulus of Assam Bora rice starch were also compared with that of Starch 1500 ®. It has been also brought into result that compactibility of Assam Bora rice starch was not affected by the blending time. Further compaction properties of the experimental starch were evaluated by using Kawakita and Heckel equations and compared well with those of Starch 1500 ®. The result obtained shows that it mainly deforms by plastic deformation. Their onset of plastic deformation and strain rate sensitivity as compared to that of Starch 1500 ® demonstrates its potential use as a direct compression filler-binders.",1

6026,13617,"Starches are used as fillers, binders, and disintegrating agents in the tablet formulation due to their suitable physicochemical as well as mechanical properties. In the present investigation, a study has been done on the compaction properties of Assam Bora rice starch, and their physicochemical properties are evaluated. Assam Bora rice starch exhibit good flow properties. The influences of physical and geometrical properties of starch were evaluated with regard to their compression properties. Further compaction properties of the Assam Bora rice starch were evaluated by density measurement, Heckel and Kawakita equation. The result obtained shows that Assam Bora rice starch deforms mainly by plastic deformation. From the study it has been concluded that Assam Bora rice starch would be more useful in minimizing the problems of lamination and capping especially on high speed tableting machine with short dwelling time for the plastic deformation of material, on the other hand it would be more useful when high tensile strength of tablet is desirable.",1

6028,13619,"The aim of this study was to develop a novel colon targeted matrix tablet containing Metronidazole (MTZ) as model drug. Matrix tablets were prepared using Assam Bora rice starch, which is essentially a natural polymer, by wet granulation technique. The granules prepared were subjected to evaluation for angle of repose, bulk density, compressibility index, Hausners ratio, total porosity, and drug content. The developed tablets were also analysed for thickness, diameter, weight variation tests, tablet crushing strength, friability, and in vitro release studies. The granules displayed satisfactory flow properties, compressibility, Hausnerapos;s ratio and drug content. Almost all the tablet formulations showed acceptable pharmacotechnical properties and complied with the in-house developed specifications for the tested parameters. Drug release study confirmed to the initial fast release in the acidic environment of surface adhered drug followed by slow release in alkaline media subsequently leading to fast and major drug release in the caecal content. Furthermore, the release of drug was unaffected by the hostile environment of GIT which can be ascribed to microbial degradation, promptly followed by enzymatic degradation. Curve fitting proved that the drug release from the tablets followed the Higuchi model. In vitro bacterial inhibition studies illustrated that the released drugs were able to diffuse through agar medium, inhibiting MTZ sensitive Bacteroides fragilis. The selected MTZ matrix tablets (F1-F6) had zones of inhibition paralleling those of the marketed formulation.",1

It’s such a pity as Mr Vampire is one of the best horror-comedies that the 80s put out and because it’s not Anglo-centric, it opens up a whole new world of mythology, superstitions, beliefs and magic that we, in the West, are totally unfamiliar with.",1
6097,13688,"Sammo Hong’s Encounters of the Spooky Kind in 1980 had set the precedent for this horror-comedy-kung fu hybrid genre, but it is with Mr Vampire where this niche genre really struck gold.

The physical humour has not dated in the slightest, made more absurd by the crazy situations in which the characters find themselves facing. Nothing is lost in the translation between East and West – if anything, the film is all the better for having an element of the exotic and the unknown as it makes things more interesting than your generic Western horror-comedy. Mr Vampire is still relatively unknown to a lot of Western audiences.

6098,13689,"Ko and his assistants have to deal with some Jianghsi. And if you don’t know what they are, then the film does a decent job of covering the bases. These Jiangshi, hopping vampires from Chinese folklore, are not like our Western vampires in the slightest (no dressing in smart suits with cloaks, changing into bats, being scared of garlic, etc). Some audiences may find the sight of the ghosts decked out in 1600s Qing dynasty era clothing, arms outstretched and hopping along in lines to be rather comical but there’s nothing funny about how deadly these things actually are. Whilst Mr Vampire plays up on the comedic aspects of the vampires, they can kill you in many different ways and are a lot tougher to beat than Count Dracula and co. It is this unveiling of Chinese folklore to those not familiar with it that will be one of the biggest appeals to Anglo horror fans – it adds unpredictability to the narrative. You’re not quite sure how the threat will be dealt with but are introduced to all sorts of magical papers, chicken blood recipes and sticky rice methods which are the Asian equivalents of your wooden stakes and garlic to a vampire.",1
6099,13690,"It takes a good thirty minutes or so for Mr Vampire to really kick into action gear but it doesn’t stop from that point onwards. You could argue that the film is little more than a series of kung fu-comedy set pieces and I couldn’t really disagree. The narrative is a little wonky at times, with the main premise being too thinly-written to really stretch out over the whole feature length time. There is a slight deviation throughout Mr Vampire, no doubt to boost up the running time, featuring one of Ko’s assistants falling in love with a ghost and Ko having to break the curse. Whilst this doesn’t add anything to the narrative in the slightest, it isn’t an unwelcome side-track as there is plenty of comedy to be had watching Ko attempt to save his assistant. From then on, the madcap film just goes in a crazy ride through a number of sequences which perfectly blend some fantastic choreography alongside a number of real laugh-out-loud moments. Nobody seems to take a breath either",1
6100,13691,"Lam Ching-Yang made an appearance in the aforementioned Encounters of the Spooky Kind but here he gets a leading role and makes it his own. Lam is fantastic in the role, trying to deadpan most of what is going on but getting bogged down in the madcap stupidity of his assistants in the process. He can handle the stunt work perfectly and has the role of the Tao priest down to a tee – it’s a role he felt typecast by, but the film gave him his big break and he starred in no fewer than eight sequels and knock-offs of Mr Vampire. Both Ricky Hiu and Chin Siu-ho are hilarious as his bumbling assistants and the three make for an effective trio. The stunning Siu-Fung Wong is also a nice addition to the cast as the ghost who bewitches one of Ko’s assistants.",1
6101,13692,"If you’re worried about indulging in something as far away from the streams of watered-down Western horror-comedies as you can possibly get, then Mr Vampire is your answer – if you can obtain a copy. A relentless, hilariously entertaining mix of kung-fu, horror and comedy, made with real enthusiasm and zest, it’s definitely one of the best films to ever come out of Hong Kong. The fact that it is so little known in the West is both a travesty or a well-kept secret, depending on your outlook.",1

6107,13698,"Objective: To observe the pattern of injuries in patients involved in different kinds of trauma presenting to the Accident and Emergency Department of Jinnah Hospital Lahore. Design: A prospective descriptive epidemiological study. Place and duration of study: Accident and emergency department of Jinnah Hospital Lahore. From 1st April 2005 to 30th September 2005. Subjects and methods: The study included patients presenting with different kinds of trauma to the emergency department of Jinnah Hospital, Lahore. They were further categorized into trauma of different regions of the body i.e. upper limb, lower limb, abdomen, head & neck, thorax and perineum. Then frequency of different types of trauma was determined. Results: During this period (1st April2005 to 30th September 2005), 111`413 patients presented in accident and emergency department and 4680 patients had traumatic injury. 1404 patients (30%) had blunt trauma, 134(2.86%) had penetrating firearms injury, 2433(51.99%) had penetrating sharp injury an d 709 patients (15.15%) had crush injury. Most patients got upper limb, lower limb, head & neck and abdominal injuries, in that order. Most patients received multiple injuries. 3340 patients (71.36%) got only minor surgery like stitching under local anaesthesia and 468 patients (10%) had no surgery at all. 872 patients (18.63%) underwent some kind of major surgical procedure like amputation, exploratory laparotomy, or stitching under GA etc. Conclusion: Trauma is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among all age groups. Most of the trauma victims receiving minor injuries can be treated at primary heath care centers. This can decrease the load of tertiary care hospitals. Maximum impact in reducing the burden of trauma must come from injury prevention strategies.",1

However, even though these arguments do show that copying other people’s intellectual contribution is wrong, they do not apply to the copying of words. Copying a few sentences that contain no original idea (e.g. in the introduction) is of marginal importance compared to stealing the ideas of others.

6117,13708,"Certain issues raised by Mr. Brumfiel’s article (“Turkish physicists face accusations of plagiarism” Nature 449, 8, 2007) must be addressed. It mustn’t be over looked that as yet there isn’t enough information to assess the situation thoroughly, and this essentially precludes the ability to make an ethical analysis of the situation. Although they contain some fallacies such as ad populum and non sequitor, some of the arguments made in their own defense by the accused academicians deserve to be considered seriously. For instance, they have publicly declared that some of the articles they have been accused of plagiarising were published after their work. Therefore language such as “allegedly” or “seem to be involved” is correct, not politically but factually. However, the sentence, “There are some cultures in which plagiarism is not even regarded as deplorable” is a counter-example. I’m not aware of any sociological research concerning this premise, perhaps it’s true; nevertheless, its inclusion makes the language value-laden. Since culture includes moral values which have been shaped and changed by various factors, it’s a mistake to discuss the moral atmosphere surrounding a certain scientific community without considering the factors which have shaped it, such as English barriers, as Mr. Smith mentioned (“Need to speak English puts burden on Asian scientists” Nature 445, 256, 2007), and local factors, such as those in Mr. Sarioglu’s formula: “They’re isolated, their English is bad, and they need to publish”. What Mr. Sarioglu didn’t include is ‘their work should interest Western editors’. If scientific work is assessed regarding editors’ interests per se, not the needs of a particular society, then publishing transforms to some kind of a price to pay, and end transforms to means.”",2
6118,13709,"It is possible to plagiarize not only the work of others, but also one's own work through re-use of identical or nearly identical portions of manuscripts without acknowledgement and without citation. Simultaneous or subsequent submission of similar manuscripts with only minor differences and without citation between the manuscripts is, unfortunately, a not uncommon practice by authors hoping to acquire multiple publications from a research project. PMB strongly discourages this practice and will act against it if the facts become known before publication. In extreme cases of self-plagiarism (duplicate publication of a (nearly) full paper which has already been published elsewhere in a peer-review journal) sanctions similar to those outlined above may be applied. Occasionally similar articles may legitimately be published in two journals, because the journals reach different audiences and both would be interested in the article.

6341,11500,"Criminal procedure in the common law world is being recast in the image of human rights. The cumulative impact of human rights laws, both inter-national and domestic, presages a revolution in common law procedural traditions. Comprising 16 essays plus the editors’ thematic introduction, this volume explores various aspects of the ‘human rights revolution’ in criminal evidence and procedure in Australia, Canada, England and Wales, Hong Kong, Malaysia, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Singapore, Scotland, South Africa and the USA. The contributors provide expert evaluations of their own domestic law and practice with frequent reference to comparative experiences in other jurisdictions. Some essays focus on specific topics, such as evidence obtained by torture, the presumption of innocence, hearsay, the privilege against self-incrimination, and ‘rape shield’ laws. Others seek to draw more general lessons about the context of law reform, the epistemic demands of the right to a fair trial, the domestic impact of supra-national legal standards (especially the ECHR), and the scope for reimagining common law procedures through the medium of human rights.This edited collection showcases the latest theoretically informed, meth-odologically astute and doctrinally rigorous scholarship in criminal proce-dure and evidence, human rights and comparative law, and will be a major addition to the literature in all of these fields.",1

Refusing leave, Ribeiro PJ, on behalf of the Court, considered that based on the natural meaning of the words in s.25 (1), “dealing with property” was the actus reus required to be proved by the Prosecution, not “dealing with the proceeds of an indictable offence.” The status of the “property”, namely the belief or knowledge that it was such proceeds, was the mens rea.

At trial, the Prosecution case was that movement of funds in Yeung’s five bank accounts bore the hallmarks of money laundering.",3
6368,11527,"One of the questions which have been certified for appeal is whether the Prosecution must prove that the proceeds that were dealt with were in fact the proceeds of an indictable offence, or in other words, “criminal property”.

6369,11528,"In HKSAR v Wong Ping Shui & Another (2001) 4 HKCFAR 29, the applicant for leave to appeal raised a technical argument, comparing the status of “property” in the context of an offence of s.25 (1) Organized and Serious Crime Ordinance (Cap. 455) to that of “property” in the context of an offence of handling stolen goods under s.24 (1) Theft Ordinance (Cap. 210). Refusing leave, Ribeiro PJ, on behalf of the Court, considered that based on the natural meaning of the words in s.25 (1), “dealing with property” was the actus reus required to be proved by the Prosecution, not “dealing with the proceeds of an indictable offence.” The status of the “property”, namely the belief or knowledge that it was such proceeds, was the mens rea. By contrast, the status of “stolen goods” formed both actus reus and mens rea. As a consequence, the Prosecution did not have to prove that the property was in fact the proceeds of an indictable offence for an offence of money laundering under s.25 (1) to be established.",1

Noting that the purpose of the Convention was to combat the vicious cycle of drug trafficking and funding through proceeds laundering, Lord Hope considered that the Prosecution had to prove that the proceeds were in fact “criminal property” for offences of money laundering to be established.",1

This is in “sharp contrast” to the language of the money laundering legislative provisions which were the subject of consideration in Montila (paragraph [100]).

The concept of commitment has therefore become primitive among workers because their basic needs are not being fulfilled adequately. This can be elaborated upon by Hofstede 's Framework for Assessing Cultures, particularly the dimension of Long-term versus Short-term orientation.

6521,11173,"India hosts the world’s second largest population and offers the world’s largest potential for urbanization. India’s urbanization trajectory will have crucial implications on its future GHG emission levels. Using household microdata from India’s 60 largest cities, this study maps GHG emissions patterns and its determinants. It also ranks the cities with respect to their household actual and “counter-factual” GHG emissions from direct energy use. We find that household GHG emissions from direct energy use correlate strongly with income and household size; population density, basic urban services (municipal water, electricity, and modern cooking-fuels access) and cultural, religious, and social factors explain more detailed emission patterns. We find that the “greenest” cities (on the basis of household GHG emissions) are Bareilly and Allahabad, while the “dirtiest” cities are Chennai and Delhi; however, when we control for socioeconomic variables, the ranking changes drastically. In the control case, we find that smaller lower-income cities emit more than expected, and larger high-income cities emit less than expected in terms of counter-factual emissions. Emissions from India’s cities are similar in magnitude to China’s cities but typically much lower than those of comparable U.S. cities. Our results indicate that reducing urban heat-island effects and the associated cooling degree days by greening, switching to modern nonsolid cooking fuels, and anticipatory transport infrastructure investments are key policies for the low-carbon and inclusive development of Indian cities.",1

6533,11190,been appointed on 31.01.1994 and for directions to release her unpaid,1
6534,11191,wages. The learned Single Judge also directed the appellants to allow,1
6535,11192,the respondent to rejoin her services as daily wager and allow her to,1
6536,11193,"continue till the appointment order is issued in her favour. However, the",1
6537,11194,period from 01.02.2001 up to passing of the order by the learned Single,1
6538,11195,Judge was to be counted for her seniority purposes only and she was,1
6539,11196,held not entitled to any wages for that period.,1
6540,11197,2. The case of the respondent before the learned Single Judge was,1
6541,11198,"that , respondent was appointed as a daily wager by order dated",1
6542,11199,"31.01.1994 under the orders of Deputy Director Technical Education,",1

6547,11204,"service, she has not been regularized.",1
6548,11205,3. The stand of the appellants before the learned Single Judge was,1
6549,11206,that respondent having been appointed by incompetent authority after,1
6550,11207,"imposition of the ban by the Government on such engagements, the",1
6551,11208,respondent is not entitled to the benefits of SRO 64 of 1994 and her,1

6553,11210,admitted the fact that the respondent has served up to 01.02.2001.,1
6554,11211,4. The contention of the learned counsel appearing for the,1
6555,11212,appellants is that respondent having been engaged after the imposition,3
6556,11213,"of ban by the government on such engagements, she was not at all",3
6557,11214,entitled for regularization. It is also contended that the respondent was,1
6558,11215,engaged by an incompetent authority and all such persons who were,1
6559,11216,"appointed after the imposition of the ban by the Government, were",1
6560,11217,"disengaged, therefore, the respondent could not have been regularized.",3
6561,11218,5. Learned counsel appearing for the respondent on the other hand,1
6562,11219,has contended that the cut off date originally fixed to give benefit under,1
6563,11220,SRO 64 of 1994 as on 01.04.1994 was extended up to 06.11.2001. He,1

6568,11225,and ors v. Shahida Bano) of which one of us ( N. Paul Vasanthakumar-,1

6586,11243,in pursuance to Cabinet Decision No.135/11(B) dated,1
6587,11244,10.09.2001. The above referred judgment was,1

6589,11246,Civil Appeal No.9298 of 2003 and Civil Appeal NO.9299,1
6590,11247,of 2003. While disposing of Civil Appeal No.9299 of,1
6591,11248,"2003, the following order has been passed:-",1
6592,11249,Our attention has been drawn to the judgment of,1

6595,11252,"In our view, this judgment has no application in view of",1
6596,11253,the fact that the respondents are employed by the State,1
6597,11254,Government and are claiming the benefit of a scheme,1
6598,11255,"formulated by the Notification dated 31st January, 1994,",1
6599,11256,"as modified by Notification dated 6th November, 2001.",1
6600,11257,The High Court is perfectly justified in its judgment.,1
6601,11258,We are satisfied that the impugned judgment of the High,1
6602,11259,Court needs no interference at our hands.,1
6603,11260,14. What would emerge from above is that the daily rated,1
6604,11261,workers/ work charged employees who were appointed,1
6605,11262,after imposition of ban and continued beyond ban period,1
6606,11263,"were given benefit of notification dated 6th November,",1
6607,11264,"2001, which, in-effect, would mean that the daily rated",1
6608,11265,workers/ work charged employees engaged even after,1
6609,11266,"01.04.1994 till 6th November, 2001, were also entitled to",1

6615,11272,off date stands settled. The learned Single Judge having arrived at such,1
6616,11273,a conclusion and granted relief to the respondent and ordering,1
6617,11274,"regularization of her services, and having held that respondent would not",1
6618,11275,be entitled to the wages from 01.02.2001 till the date of the order of the,1

The study was done with an objective to evaluate the different causative factors for delayed presentation of appendicitis. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in the Surgical “C” unit, at Ayub Teaching Hospital, Abbottabad, Pakistan from 20th June 2013 to 19th June 2014. A total of 130 patients presented with appendicitis in OPDs or emergency department. Detailed history, general physical and systemic examination especially abdominal examination was done along with investigations. Results: It was found that 23.08% of complicated appendicitis presentation is due to missed diagnosis by physicians, 30.77% is due to missed diagnosis by non-doctors, 23.08% is due to conservative management at DHQ hospitals by surgeons, and 23.08% presented late because of self-medication at home. Conclusion: All patients with pain Right iliac fossa, there should be suspected of appendicitis. Proper workup should be done to exclude it.

6703,11434,"It's disappointing that Lam Ching-Ying gets a lot less screen-time this time around, although the producers do make up for that by casting Yuen Biao in a central role; a disappointment then that Biao doesn't get to take part in much martial arts. Too much of the narrative is taken up by the vampire kid, although things do hit a high note at the climax which offers more of the traditional vampire action that you'd expect.

Actors are all average, direction is fine, and there's really nothing wrong with the movie (if you are into this kind of stuff). There's also some disturbing rape scenes in the movie, which is kind of usual to cat-3 movies too. I know this movie is rarity, but it's worth seeking out for hardcore cat-3 fans.

6828,14138,"The Indian labour market is predominated by informal employment, with more than 90 per cent of informal workforce working as self-employed or casual workers. In the absence of social security benefits for informal labour, this labour category tends to be associated with lower earnings and higher risks and, therefore, prone to increased prevalence of poverty and inequality. Moreover, informality has not been limited to unorganised sector but extends increasingly to the organized, formal sector.",1
6829,14139,"India's labour-related acts and regulations are often said to be excessively pro-worker, leading mainstream analysts to contend that the state has caused labour market rigidity which, in turn, creates the shadow economy with a large share of informal labour workforce. Based on this line of analysis, mainstream analysts contend that there is a need for appropriate flexibility in Indian labour laws to compete industry globally, without compromising the labour welfare. Where such flexibility structures have failed, mainstream thinkers claim that the interventions to create flexible labour market are insufficient and weak. To address these issues there is a need, the orthodoxy claims, for enabling markets and environment for developing a 'formal' labour culture, using incremental approaches, which need a thorough understanding of mainstream labour economics (for a critical review of such mainstream narratives, readers can see Obeng-Odoom's book, Reconstructing Urban Economics: Towards a Political Economy of the Built Environment, 2016: chapter 5).",2
6830,14140,"Informal Labour in Urban India, the book under review, however, challenges this mainstream analysis. Written by political economist Tom Barnes, it contributes to conceptual and theoretical development of understanding the expansion of informal wage labour in small and large enterprises, including the organised sector. The book presents excellent empirical analyses of the informal labour market, using changes to employment in three key mega urban regions Mumbai, Bangalore, and Delhi. The book comprises of six chapters, namely: India's informal economy; mapping informal labour in India; Mumbai; Bangalore; New Delhi; informal labour and resistance.",1
6831,14141,"India's economic development differs from the West or even Northeast Asian regions. Unlike western economies, India's industrial development is dominated by informal labour employment. Based on theoretical and empirical evidence, the author presents two reasons: employers' exploitation of India's well-established social structure of accumulation, and usual global process of international competition and exchange. Notably organised sector has systematically exploited the informal labour market by sub-contracting activities or labour contract. While presenting measurement and monitoring of informal labour in three megacities, using datasets from Economic Census (EC) and National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), the book presents three perspectives of the informal economies: analytical categorisation of disadvantage and disempowerment; informal economies as diverse grouping of economic activities, in which state rules and regulations are absent, relaxed, or eroded; and dynamic historical and spatial processes linked to various types of work and employment.",1
6832,14142,"He succinctly notes Mumbai's shift towards the employment of wage labour in informal enterprises between late 1990s and mid-2000s, and explains through the structure and composition of the region's labour force. For instance, between 1998 and 2005, employment fell by about 54,000 in Own-Account Establishments (OAEs), and by 320,000 in Establishments with Hired Workers (EHWs). This shift was mainly due to the expansion of informal trading and manufacturing enterprises, the closure of factories and large-scale production units, the reduction of factories' workforce by rationalising production or attrition through voluntary retirement schemes, and restructuring of industrial labour into smaller units to enhance control of the production process or to avoid protective labour laws. …",1

6839,14149,"So far, little is known about the interaction of nanoparticles with lung cells, the entering of nanoparticles, and their transport through the blood stream to other organs. The entering and localization of different nanoparticles consisting of differing materials and of different charges were studied in human red blood cells. As these cells do not have any phagocytic receptors on their surface, and no actin-myosin system, we chose them as a model for nonphagocytic cells to study how nanoparticles penetrate cell membranes. We combined different microscopic techniques to visualize fine and nanoparticles in red blood cells: (I) fluorescent particles were analyzed by laser scanning microscopy combined with digital image restoration, (II) gold particles were analyzed by conventional transmission electron microscopy and energy filtering transmission electron microscopy, and (III) titanium dioxide particles were analyzed by energy filtering transmission electron microscopy. By using these differing microscopic techniques we were able to visualize and detect particles ≤0.2 μm and nanoparticles in red blood cells. We found that the surface charge and the material of the particles did not influence their entering. These results suggest that particles may penetrate the red blood cell membrane by a still unknown mechanism different from phagocytosis and endocytosis.",1

7000,13527,"Previously, we have developed a colloidal dextran-stabilized monocrystalline iron oxide nanocompound (MION-46) as a magnetic label for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In an effort to use this magnetic label to visualize pancreatic receptor function by MRI in vivo, we investigated the potential of secretin as a vector molecule. Secretin receptors, abundant on exocrine pancreas cells, recognize secretin through its amidated carboxyl terminal. In order to conjugate secretin to MION, we utilized the specific interaction between biotin and streptavidin, since direct conjugation of human secretin to MION has previously resulted in low yields and low affinity of the conjugate (unpublished results). Initially, we biotinylated the N-terminal primary amino group of secretin (60% yield). In a separate step, streptavidin (SA) was immobilized onto the surface dextran molecules of MION (79% yield) by reductive amination. Each secretin molecule was conjugated to one biotin molecule and each MION particle to an average of two SA molecules. The biotinylated secretin was then conjugated to MION through the biotin−streptavidin interaction (90% yield). The secretin−biotin−streptavidin−MION construct thus contained approximately two secretin molecules per MION. An in vitro competitive binding assay of pancreatic acinar cells demonstrated that the magnetically labeled secretin retained affinity to the secretin receptors. In vivo distribution studies in rats showed a significantly higher pancreatic accumulation of the secretin−biotin−streptavidin−MION construct as compared to the control group that had received unmodified MION. Our data indicate that bioactive peptides can be attached to dextran-coated iron oxide particles through the biotin−streptavidin interaction while retaining receptor affinity.

7125,10458,"Numbering more than 150 million, Muslims constitute the largest minority in India, yet they suffer the most politically and socioeconomically. Forced to contend with severe and persistent prejudice, India’s Muslims are often targets of violence and collective acts of murder. While the quality of Muslim life may lag behind that of Hindus nationally, local and inclusive cultures have been resilient in the south and the east. Within India’s cities, however, the challenges Muslims face can be harder to read. In the Hindi belt and in the north, Muslims have known less peace, especially in the riot-prone areas of Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Jaipur, and Aligarh, and in the capitals of former Muslim states—Delhi, Hyderabad, Bhopal, and Lucknow. These cities are rife with Muslim ghettos and slums. However, self-segregation has also played a part in forming Muslim enclaves, such as in Delhi and Aligarh, where traditional elites and a new Muslim middle class have regrouped for physical and cultural protection. Combining firsthand testimony with sound critical analysis, this volume follows urban Muslim life in eleven Indian cities, providing uncommon insight into a little-known but highly consequential subject.",1
7126,10459,"In today's neo-liberal economic milieu, Muslims in Delhi are being rediscovered as a human resource that is positioned as a specific part in the accumulation project which has little use for prejudice per se, but only to the extent that it aides the project. Muslims are grateful for jobs and businesses that take advantage of their skills, time, labour and assets and other supposed integrative advantages that this relationship brings with it. These neighbourhoods in Delhi are integrated in the city economy, and even global economy, but only so far as the balance of accumulation of capital is tipped in favour of spaces elsewhere.",1
7127,10460,"Using Delhi's contemporary history as a site for reflection, Pirate Modernity moves from a detailed discussion of the technocratic design of the city by US planners in the 1950s, to the massive expansions after 1977, culminating in the urban crisis of the 1990s. As a practice, pirate modernity is an illicit form of urban globalization. Poorer urban populations increasingly inhabit non-legal spheres: unauthorized neighborhoods, squatter camps and bypass legal technological infrastructures (media, electricity). This pirate culture produces a significant enabling resource for subaltern populations unable to enter the legal city. Equally, this is an unstable world, bringing subaltern populations into the harsh glare of permanent technological visibility, and attacks by urban elites, courts and visceral media industries. The book examines contemporary Delhi from some of these sites: the unmaking of the citys modernist planning design, new technological urban networks that bypass states and corporations, and the tragic experience of the road accident terrifyingly enhanced by technological culture. Pirate Modernity moves between past and present, along with debates in Asia, Africa and Latin America on urbanism, media culture, and everyday life. This pioneering book suggests cities have to be revisited afresh after proliferating media culture. Pirate Modernity boldly draws from urban and cultural theory to open a new agenda for a world after media urbanism.",1
7128,10461,"A discourse analysis of court documents in slum-related cases from the past 25 years leads to the conclusion that the basic statement that ""slums are illegal"" is a very recent juridical discourse and the rise of court orders to demolish slums is due to reinterpretation of nuisance law.

7129,10462,"‘The plight of Muslim women’ periodically surfaces in the Indian media as well as in academic forums. These discussions often focus on the tropes of parda, polygamy and personal laws with ‘Muslim women’ often placed in the position of symbolic bearers of the identity of ‘the Muslim community’. This article explores the construction of ‘Muslim women in India’ outside of media and academic discourses, looking at the ways that women, who are identified as Muslim, themselves construct this category in their personal narratives. The analysis is based on discussions with women living in a majority-Muslim area of Delhi, Zakir Nagar. These discussions reveal competing constructions of ‘Muslim women’ in relation to parda and personal laws as well as in comparison with various groups including ‘Hindu women’, ‘the poor’, and ‘the uneducated’. ‘Muslim women’ is thus revealed as a category that has limited and differing resonance in the ways that women themselves represent their identities. The article calls for an exploration of women's identities outside of the over-determined category ‘Muslim women’, taking into account multiple and contingent identifications including religion but also including class, regional affiliation, age, migration history, status, etc.",1
7130,10463,"The world population is increasing very rapidly, overwhelming all efforts to provide adequate housing. The urban population is growing at a much faster rate than the population as a whole, with most of the increase expected to occur in the developing countries. This poses a huge challenge to those responsible for the provision of housing and basic services. The aim of this paper is to suggest an approach to improve housing delivery systems for large cities in developing countries, to help to meet this challenge. A variety of cities from both developed and developing countries were examined to generate alternatives for the various stages of the housing delivery system. These alternatives were then tested for the city of Delhi, India, through interviews with the different actors in the housing delivery system. This produced suggestions for each of the stages of the housing delivery system for Delhi. Examination of the alternatives showed that for the most part they would be applicable to other cities of less developed countries. However, for some of the stages the political, social or cultural situation in particular cities requires individual selection from the possible alternatives. In such cases, the method developed can be applied to make an appropriate selection.",1
7131,10464,"The author defines classic ghetto as the result of the involuntary spatial segregation of a group that stands in a subordinate political and social relationship to its surrounding society, the enclave as a voluntarily developed spatial concentration of a group for purposes of promoting the welfare of its members, and the citadel as created by a dominant group to protect or enhance its superior position. The author describes a new phenomenon, connected to global economic changes: the outcast ghetto, inhabited by those excluded from the mainstream economy by the forces of macroeconomic developments. The distinction among these differing forms of spatial separation is crucial for a number of public policies.",1
7132,10465,"Lattice towers and guyed masts are frequently used in the telecommunication industry, particularly to support antennas. These structural systems comprise a large number of elements (mainly, legs and diagonals) and for this reason, their representation by equivalent models is quite common and convenient. In a previous study, the authors derived a continuous model of a spatial lattice governed by ... [Show full abstract] nine differential equations (9DE). The legs trace forms a triangle and the diagonals with a zig-zag pattern are contained in three planes that join each two legs, defined as Pattern 1. Here and starting from an energy statement, the structural behavior of a 1D continuous model governed by six differential equations (6DE) which leads to a simpler representation of the lattice structure, is stated. This formulation considers the shear flexibility and the second order effect due to axial loads. Also, the inertial forces due to the legs and diagonals masses are taken into account. Numerical examples dealing with deflections, critical buckling loads and natural frequencies are solved with this 1D model. The results are compared with the outcomes found with finite element methods. A very good performance is attained with the proposed model. Finally, the equivalent properties for other patterns of diagonalization (Patterns 2, 3 and 4) different to the studied as well as the formulas to find the critical loads are included in Appendices.",1

This interpretation was affirmed in Oei Hengky Wiryo v HKSAR (No 2) (2007) 10 HKCFAR 98 after the Court of Final Appeal took into consideration the decision of the House of Lords in R v Montilla [2004] 1 WLR 3141, in which a contrary view was adopted regarding the old UK offences set out in s 93C(2) of the Criminal Justice Act (‘CJA’) 1988 and s 49(2) of the Drug Trafficking Act (‘DTA’) 1994. The Oei Hengky Wiryo decision was subsequently affirmed in HKSAR v Li Kwok Cheung George (2014) 17 HKCFAR 319. However, Counsel on behalf of Mr Yeung argued that Oei Hengky Wiryo was wrongly decided and adopted the approach decided in Montila. Counsel contended that the words ‘that property’ at the end of s 25(1) referred to the immediately preceding phrase ‘any person’s proceeds of an indictable offence’.

7217,10609,"To recap, the whole Saga began when Yeung was charged with and convicted in the District Court of five charges of “dealing with property believed to represent proceeds of an indictable offence” under section 25(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) (“OSCO”) back in early 2014. Yeung’s appeal against his convictions was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 13 May 2015. This led to the present appeal before the Court of Final Appeal which ruled against Yeung on 11 July 2016 (HKSAR v Yeung Ka-sing, Carson, FACC 5/2015, FACC6/2015).",3
7218,10610,"In our previous newsletter “The Soccer Boss Saga: Carson Yeung and Money-laundering (Part III) – How is the “Reasonable Grounds to Believe Test” Applied?”, we have discussed the Court of Appeal’s analysis and application of the “reasonable grounds to believe test” in dismissing Yeung’s previous appeal. This article will discuss the Court of Final Appeal’s analysis of several key legal issues relating to the offence under section 25 of OSCO.",1
7219,10611,"on a charge of dealing with proceeds of crime contrary to section 25(1) of OSCO, whether it is necessary for prosecution to prove that the proceeds being dealt with were in fact proceeds of an indictable offence (“Proceeds Issue”);",1
7220,10612,"Section 25(1) of OSCO provides that “…a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person’s proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property” (emphasis added). In appealing against his conviction, Yeung sought to persuade the Court to overturn its decision in Oei Hengky Wiryo v HKSAR (No 2) FACC4/2006, in which the Court had held that section 25(1) did not require for proving the property in question represented proceeds of an indictable offence. Instead, Yeung argued that, on a true reading of section 25(1) of OSCO, the words “that property” ought to be understood as the property which in fact represented some persons’ proceeds of an indicatable offence.",1
7221,10613,"Having looked at legislative history of OSCO, the Court rejected Yeung’s arguments. The Court observed that, while the old section 25 did require the property in question to represent the proceeds of an indictable offence in the hands of a specified relevant person, the 1995 amendments to the OSCO had radically changed and expanded the basis of liability so as to abandon the elements under the old section 25. In fact, the current offence is defined as dealing with “any property”, and such a definition strongly indicates that the statutory intention is to avoid imposing any requirement of proof that the property dealt with actually represents the proceeds of indictable crime. Rather, the focus of the current section 25 offence is on the circumstances surrounding the accused’ acts of dealing with the property in question. In light of such observation, the Court upheld its decision in Oei Hengky Wiryo and held that it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove, as an element of the offence, that the proceeds being dealt with were in fact the proceeds of an indictable offence.",2
7222,10614,"The Court relied on its decisions in HKSAR v Pang Hung Fai, FACC8/2013, and other cases to address the Mental Element Issue. In gist, the Court found that section 25(1) of OSCO requires proof that the accused had the requisite reasonable grounds to believe and the Court should look at the grounds which were available to the accused. There was also the additional requirement that the grounds must be reasonable, that is, that everyone looking at those grounds objectively would so believe.",1
7223,10615,"In the case where the Court had rejected the accused’s evidence as to his state of mind, the Court held that there was no requirement that it must make findings as to his “belief, thoughts and intentions at the material time”. Instead, the Court should act according to the state of evidence which remained and ask whether all the elements of the offence had been established beyond reasonable doubt.",1
7224,10616,"In the present case, Yeung had testified and called evidence with a view to providing explanations for the funds flowing through his bank accounts and to negating the existence of reasonable grounds on his part to believe that such funds were the proceeds of crime. He was, however, almost entirely disbelieved by the lower Court. That left the lower Court with the task of deciding whether, on the evidence which it accepted, the section 25(1) offences were made out beyond reasonable doubt, which it held so. The Court found there was no error of law involved in the lower Court reaching that conclusion.",1
7225,10617,"As to the correct meaning of the words “having reasonable grounds to believe”, the Court rejected the suggestion that the test of the mental elements of section 25 of OSCO could be formulated using the words “knew or ought to have known” referred to in Pang Hung Fai, which seemed to connote the standard of negligence. By looking at the judgment of Pang Hung Fai as a whole, the Court found no basis for thinking that the Court intended, by a single sentence in the judgment, to introduce a wholly different basis for liability based on some purely external standard of negligence. As such, the Court affirmed the test of “having reasonable grounds to believe”, namely that the accused must have grounds for believing and those grounds must be reasonable.",1
7226,10618,"With the dismissal of his final appeal, Yeung would need to serve the remaining of his 6 years’ sentence in prison. Nevertheless, Yeung’s appeal did bring before the Court several key questions of law in relation to elements of the offence under section 25 of OSCO, the uncertainties have finally been cleared by the Court of Final Appeal.

7257,9560,The Guo laboratory research is mainly focused on understanding the pathogenesis of HBV infection and discovering antiviral and immune modulating agents to treat chronic hepatitis B. It also has a long-term research effort toward understanding how interferons control virus infection and how viruses evade innate antiviral immune responses to colonize their hosts.,1
7258,9561,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection affects more than 240 million people worldwide. Although there are 7 medications have been approved by US FDA for treatment of chronic hepatitis B and they are efficacious in suppressing HBV replication, reducing viral load and improving clinical manifestations, they rarely induce a sustained, off-drug control of HBV replication, HBsAg loss or seroconversion (a functional cure). The reasons are those medications, particularly HBV DNA polymerase inhibitors, fail to eliminate (or repress) cccDNA and restore a functional antiviral immune response against HBV. Accordingly, our HBV research program is to understand the molecular basis of cccDNA metabolism, transcription regulation and their modulation by host immune responses. The Guo lab’s ultimate goals are to therapeutically eliminate/repress cccDNA and restore an effective host immune response against HBV to cure the chronic HBV infection.",1
7259,9562,"Molecular pathogenesis of chronic HBV infection One of the major remaining mysteries about the pathogenesis of HBV is how the host immune system resolves the virus infection and eliminates the nuclear form of the viral genome, the covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA. Following entry of HBV into hepatocytes, the viral relaxed circular (rc) DNA genome is transported into the nucleus and converted into cccDNA with the help of cellular DNA repair machinery. CCC DNA associates with histones and assembles into episomal minichromosome, which is the transcriptional template for viral mRNA. Persistent HBV infection relies on stable maintenance and proper functioning of cccDNA. Thus, resolution of infection depends upon elimination and/or transcriptional suppression of cccDNA. The Guo lab’s current research is to investigate the molecular mechanism of cccDNA biosynthesis, maintenance, transcription regulation and their regulation by host innate immune response, particularly, interferons and other inflammatory cytokines.",1
7260,9563,"Innate immunity against HBV infectionHBV was considered a stealth virus that induces negligible innate immune responses during the early phase of infection. However, recent studies with newly developed experimental systems revealed that the virus infection can be recognized, at least under selected conditions, by pattern recognition receptors, and elicits a cytokine response that controls the replication of the virus. In addition, it has also been shown that the functional status of intrahepatic innate immunity determines the activation and maturation of HBV-specific adaptive immune response and thus the outcomes of HBV infection. Encouragingly, pharmacological activation of intrahepatic innate immune response with TLR7/8/9 or STING agonists efficiently controls HBV infection in preclinical studies and thus holds great promise for the cure of chronic hepatitis B. Accordingly, our current research is to investigate under what the condition and how cGAS-STING pathway recognizes HBV infection and determine the molecular mechanism by which STING agonist-induced antiviral response controls HBV replication.",1
7261,9564,"Discovery and development of antiviral and host innate immunity modulating agents for treatment of chronic hepatitis B As an extension of our basic research projects on HBV pathogenesis and innate immunity, we have also developed cell-based assays suitable for high throughput screening of antiviral agents and innate immunity agonists to treat chronic HBV infection. Specifically, our antiviral agent discovery and development program focuses on discovering small molecular inhibitors of HBV replication, particularly to target the steps of capsid assembly, pgRNA encapsidation, viral DNA synthesis, cccDNA formation, maintenance and transcription of viral RNA. Two chemically distinct classes of HBV nucleocapsid assembly inhibitors have been discovered and are currently under preclinical development. The Guo lab is also discovering human STING agonists in collaboration with Drs. Jinhong Chang and Yanming Du.",1
7262,9565,"Interferons (IFN) are the primary mediators of host innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses. Taking a forward genetic approach, the laboratory has identified interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that suppress the infection of HBV, HCV, flaviviruses and human coronaviruses during the last decade. We are now particularly interested in understanding the antiviral mechanism of three membrane-associated ISGs, viperin, tetherin and IFITMs. While viperin inhibits RNA replication of HCV and flaviviruses, tetherin and IFITMs inhibit a broad-spectrum of viruses by disrupting their egress from infected cells and entry into their host cells, respectively. Intriguingly, we also found that at least one virus, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), can use IFITM proteins to facilitate its entry into host cells, most likely by promoting the fusion between viral envelope and endosomal membranes. Further genetic and biochemical studies are currently under way to investigate the mechanisms by which those antiviral ISGs, particularly the IFITM proteins, modulate virus infection.",1

Method: A composite index is proposed combining data on commuting patterns and carbon footprints of respective transport means to rank each district based on current performance and related environmental and health impacts. The research is evidenced on the city of London, United Kingdom, but is designed such that it could be readily applied elsewhere. Results: The outcome implies a strong distance decay effect whereby active travel is most pronounced in central districts and less so on the city fringes, Westminster and City of London score most favourably with Havering performing worst. Similarly, the central districts also have a lower carbon footprint. Discussion: The product of this research is not only a replicable and transferable framework to measure sustainable commuting given its high political importance but also a means to support decision-making and the implementation of policies to improve opportunities for low carbon and active travel and the directly related impacts on human health and the environment.",1

7352,17502,"According to an estimate, 20 percent (3.43 million) of Delhi population were residing in unauthorized settlements (including regularized) as of 2011. Interestingly, Delhis annual urban population grew at the rate of 2.45, while, population in unauthorized settlements grew at the rate of 3.1 during 2001-11. Based on the magnitude of this issue, this study aims to document innovative housing supply system in unauthorized settlements and quantify socio-economic and environmental degradation as well as annual monetary loss to all stakeholders - individual and government(s). More specifically, this study addresses - Why panning interventions failed to tackle proliferation of unauthorized housings (and settlements) in Delhi, despite success in many critical issues, for instance, improving air quality? What kinds of planning interventions lead to a win-win situation to the residents and the governments? The study employs case study method to analyse process and outcome of an unauthorized settlement, including under construction buildings in South Delhi in early 2012. Findings reveal that, present state of housing supply in unauthorized settlement impacts socio-economic conditions and significant amount of monetary loss to citizens. For instance, residents of unauthorized settlements bribe approx. USD 10 million annually on housing construction (includes illegitimate building permission and materials procurement). It also causes poor environmental outcome as well huge monetary loss to government(s). The overall housing supply system is professional and comparable to developed housing market. It includes  (a) owner as a builder (individual unit), (b) group housing by builder, and (c) partnership between owner and builder with cost sharing. In absence of recognition of system and planning interventions, it increases cost of a dwelling unit (at least over 2.5 %) and other difficulties e.g., denial of housing loans and identity. This study argues that minimal planning interventions with lower standards will enhance physical, socio-economic and environmental conditions.",1

7355,17505,"India's land transport GHG emissions are small in international comparison, but growing exponentially. Understanding of geographically-specific determinants of GHG emissions is crucial to devise low-carbon sustainable development strategies. However, previous studies on transport patterns have been limited to socio-economic context in linear and stationary settings, and with limited spatial scope. Here, we use a machine learning tool to develop a nested typology that categorizes all 640 Indian districts according to the econometrically identified drivers of their commuting emissions. Results reveal that per capita commuting emissions significantly vary over space, after controlling for socioeconomic characteristics, and are strongly influenced by built environment (e.g. urbanization, and road density), and mobility-related variables (e.g. travel distance and travel modes). The commuting emissions of districts are characterized by unique, place-specific combinations of drivers. We find that income and urbanization are dominant classifiers of commuting emissions, while we explain more fine-grained patterns with mode choice and travel distance. Surprisingly the most urbanized areas with highest population density are also associated with the highest transport GHG emissions, a result that is explained by high car ownership. This result contrasts with insights from OECD countries, where commuting emissions are associated with low-density urban sprawl. Our findings demonstrate that low-carbon commuting in India is best advanced with spatially differentiated strategies.",1

7435,17585,"On 11 July 2016, the Court of Final Appeal (“CFA”) handed down its judgment in two much anticipated decisions concerning money laundering (see FACC 5 & 6/2015 and FACC 1/2015, heard together). The ruling resolves issues which have taxed Hong Kong courts for some time and will have a significant impact on the way money laundering cases are prosecuted and defended. In this article, Morley Chow Seto outlines the key findings of import for criminal practitioners.",1
7436,17586,"On the basis of the language and structure of the Ordinance, an examination of the amendments made to the provisions creating the offence, the existence of a defence involving disclosure of suspicious transactions and a comparison with money laundering offences in other jurisdictions, the Court held that it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove, as an element of OSCO s. 25(1), that the property dealt with by the defendant in fact represents the proceeds of an indictable offence. It is only necessary for the prosecution to prove that the accused dealt with certain property in circumstances where he or she knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that such property represented the proceeds of an indictable offence.",1
7437,17587,"The Court provided clarification as to what constitutes “having reasonable grounds to believe” that property being dealt with represents any person’s proceeds of an indictable offence as prescribed by OSCO s. 25(1). It explained its earlier decision in HKSAR v Pang Hung Fai(2014) and endorsed the approach to the “reasonable grounds to believe” mental element adopted by the Appeal Committee in 1999, holding that: “To convict, the jury had to find that the accused had grounds for believing; and there was the additional requirement that the grounds must be reasonable: That is, that anyone looking at those grounds objectively would so believe.”",1
7438,17588,"In this regard, the second case concerned Mr. Salim Majed who was convicted in the District Court on four charges of money laundering contravening OSCO s. 25(1). His conviction was quashed in the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal declined to order a re-trial, holding that the charges were incurably duplicitous. The prosecution obtained leave to appeal on the duplicity issue identical to the one in Yeung’s case.",3
7439,17589,"In Hong Kong, under the Indictment Rules 1976, each paragraph (called a “count”) in an indictment can only properly allege a single offence. This is commonly referred to as the rule against duplicity. The question of duplicity arises where the conduct alleged in a charge involves a number of acts each of which is capable of being treated as a separate offence. In both cases, each of the counts charged money laundering on the basis of numerous deposits into a bank account. The Court held that the purpose of concealing the property comprising those deposits, known or reasonably believed to represent the proceeds of crime, provided a connection which made the individual deposits acts of a similar nature so that they could fairly be regarded as forming part of the same transaction or criminal enterprise. A charge unifying those deposits was therefore justified and the rule against duplicity was not infringed. In Yeung’s case, the CFA upheld the Court of Appeal’s finding that no prejudice was caused by grouping the 963 individual deposits into five charges.",3
7440,17590,"In Majed’s case his defence was that each account was established for the purpose of a legitimate business which he was intending to conduct with Mainland China. This was found to be implausible and was comprehensively rejected by the trial judge. There was no reason to think that his defence would have been any different, or more convincing, had he been charged with 46 offences, or with some different combination of offences, or that in any other respect the aggregation of charges caused any unfairness. The defence case at trial was unaffected by the number of individual acts of dealing which the prosecution alleged.",3
7441,17591,"The CFA declined to follow the law in England & Wales and confirmed the existing law in Hong Kong that the prosecution does not have to prove that the property being dealt with was, in fact, the proceeds of crime; to secure a conviction it is enough for the prosecution to establish that the defendant had reasonable grounds to believe that it was.",1
7442,17592,The prosecution does not have to charge a separate count for every act of dealing if all the acts can fairly be regarded as being part of the same criminal enterprise. A single charge can cover all the deposits laundered through a single bank account. There is no need for the prosecution to aver a single charge for each individual deposit.,1
7443,17593,"On the issue of whether a defendant had the relevant “reasonable grounds to believe” it depends on the state of the evidence. If a Defendant provides no evidence at all of his beliefs and perceptions, the Court is left to draw whatever inferences may be proper based on the prosecution evidence. Such evidence will no doubt be intended by the prosecution to be inculpatory as establishing the indicia of money laundering. But such evidence may also be exculpatory, casting doubt on whether the defendant had the necessary reasonable grounds to believe.",1

METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to general practitioners, rheumatologists, rehabilitators, and orthopaedic surgeons in five European countries (France, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy). Practitioners were asked to give their opinion on the 10 EULAR recommendations and on 23 treatment modes for KOA. Practitioners' opinions were compared with those of the expert task force involved in the development of these recommendations. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 10.4% (4204 replies). Results were similar across countries and specialties. Of the 23 treatment modes proposed, only joint lavage and intra-articular (IA) corticosteroid injections were more strongly recommended by the expert task force than by the responders as a whole, while the opposite was true for spa therapy. Principal component analysis showed: (1) some practitioners preferred ""hard line"" treatments (surgery, IA injections, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)); (2) there was a difference between those prescribing pharmacological (paracetamol) or non-pharmacological measures with low iatrogenicity (exercises, sticks, education), and those prescribing less well validated treatments closer to ""alternative"" medicine; (3) each specialist tended to advocate modes that they were most familiar with: rheumatologists were more likely to recommend IA injections and NSAIDs; orthopaedic surgeons, surgical procedures; rehabilitators, education and all non-pharmacological modes; general practitioners, spa therapy and opioids.

7879,17192,"DirtyDeedsDoneDirtCheap:140On-farm survey of farmers' breeding practices, breeding objectives, and selection criteria and on-station feedlot performance evaluation of Washera sheep were undertaken in Ethiopia. The survey revealed that most (79.8%) of the farmers had no breeding ram. The mating system was predominantly uncontrolled. A majority (75.5%) of the sheep owners reported that they herded their sheep flock by mixing with other livestock species mainly with cattle. During grazing, 44.6% of the farmers mix their sheep flock with neighboring sheep flocks. The major sheep production objective was to generate income from the sale of live sheep. Fast growth, appearance, coat color, and pedigree performance were important ram selection criteria, respectively. Ability to breed at early age, pedigree information, mothering ability, and lambing interval were important selection criteria for ewe, respectively. The on-station performance study involved evaluation of feedlot gains and carcass production under five levels of feeding regimes (300, 400, 500, 600, and 700 g day of concentrate feed) for a period of 93 days. The results indicated that the feedlot growth and carcass performance of Washera sheep were very high, with average daily weight gains of up to 126 g and carcass weight of 16 kg, with the optimal level of supplementation for Washera sheep being at 500 g of concentrate per day for a period of 93 days.",1
7880,17193,"DirtyDeedsDoneDirtCheap:178This paper discusses the applicability of translation theory in teaching practical translation. It examines the Chinese translation of an English legal judgment “Attorney General v Lee Kwong-kut and Attorney General v Lo Chak-man and another”(Hong Kong Public Law Reports, 1993) by the Privy Council. It combines the source-text analysis with translation strategies from the perspective of semantics, syntax and register, in order to discuss how theories can be applied in real-life legal translation setting. The source text contains distinctive examples of legalese, convoluted sentence structure and honorific addresses specific to Anglo legal context. The Chinese translation is challenging as to how to cope with the linguistic and cultural differences, and most significantly, how to carry over the central meanings while retaining the equivalent effect and the authenticity of a legal judgment. Furthermore, this paper is based on the author’s teaching experiences, and will refer to the syllabuses and curriculum design of the “Programme Intended Learning Outcomes” and the “Course Intended Learning Outcomes”. It demonstrates the applicable value of translation theory, and how practical translation can be taught with theoretical explanation and vice versa.Translation bases on practice, all kinds of theories area guideline to be applied.",1

7892,17205,"DirtyDeedsDoneDirtCheap:188Background: Femoral shaft fractures are common in adult population due to vulnerability to road traffic accident and firearm injuries. The Gamma nail was introduced for the treatment of subtrochanteric fractures with the theoretical advantage of a load-sharing femoral component which could be implanted by a closed procedure. Gamma nails were implanted with significantly shorter operating times, smaller incsions, and less intraoperative bleeding. Objective: To determine the outcome of Gamma nail in complex subtrochanteric femur fractures in terms of clinicoradiological evidence of union. Study Design: Descriptive case series. Setting: Department of Orthopaedics and Spinal Surgery, Ghurki Trust Teaching Hospital/Lahore Medical & Dental College, Lahore. Duration of Study with Dates: One Year (1st November, 2010 to 31st, 2011). Methods: After evaluation according to Advance Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol, 50 cases of subtrochanteric femur fractures were included. Gamma nail of appropriate size and angle was introduced with help of jig. Proximal lag screw fixation was done. Patients were mobilized on first postoperative day with help of crutches or walker. Full weight bearing was allowed within six weeks. Clinical evidence of bone healing was scored according to pain and mobility scale. Results: There were 20 males and 30 females. Male to female ratio was 1:1.5. The mean±SD between the ages was 42.24±13.76 years. There were 36 closed procedures and 14 open procedures done in all patients. The outcome of Gamma nails in complex subtrochanteric femur fractures were 43 patients having union and 7 patients have non-union. Conclusion: Gamma nail is an alternative treatment of choice for complex subtrochanteric femur fractures. It allows the patients to get out of bed early and good rates of union.",1

In this paper, flue gas was introduced into the thermal recovery process of thick heavy oil reservoir. First, the PVT experiments under different conditions were carried out to research the dissolution of flue gas in crude oil. Then, a series of 3D physical simulations were performed to study the oil displacement characteristics of flue gas coupled with steam flooding in a thick reservoir with consideration of the important production parameters including oil production, oil-to-steam ratio (OSR), water cut, and oil recovery in both the steam-flooding process and the process of steam flooding coupled with flue gas. Finally, the enhanced oil recovery mechanisms of flue gas coupled with steam flooding for thick heavy oil reservoirs were summarized on the basis of the experimental results.

I on the other hand is a bit disappointed over the entire process because i feel that demanding a nonrefundable fee in thousands and allowing any one to apply unlimited number of applications without disclosing the total number of plots available for the balloting is a bit of rip off . This launch will have just one clear winner “DHA Multan” which will collect billions just to offer people eligibility to be part of the balloting process. However “when in Rome do as the Romans do” and i did end up submitting two applications, one for a 10 Marla residential and other for a 4 Marla commercial. Some of the Guidelines i want to offer you before you make the decision to apply are as following:",1

8018,16350,Best category to apply in terms of winning chance is 1 Kanal residential file and 8 Marla commercial file. I believe that the prices are high for both these categories and the number of plots vs the number of applicants in 1 Kanal category may give you a better chance to win.,1

8022,16390,"Studies from developed economies have analyzed the key factors for understanding urban mobility, which are important to design appropriate interventions to reduce the volume of transport needs and to promote more sustainable modes of transportation. However, there are limited studies in urban areas of developing economies, which can hinder our capacity to formulate sustainable transport policies that are fit for the reality of those countries. In order to fill this gap, this study quantifies the influence of city features and socio-economic and socio-cultural variables on mobility patterns to identify evidence-based policy interventions for promoting more inclusive and sustainable transportation paths. The research estimates the amount of public and private transport (proxied by out-of-pocket travel expenditure) and modal choices, employing multivariate analyses, using a nationally representative household survey from the 98 largest Indian cities. Findings reveal that densification in Indian cities reduces the amount of transport as well as enhances the probability of using public transport. Small and medium sized cities predominantly use private transport, whereas large cities prefer public transport but lack non-motorized transportation. Moreover, income is the most important determinant of the amount of transport and the use of motorized and private transport. The top quintile is the only with positive income elasticity of transport demand. Results show that public and non-motorized transport infrastructures will provide sustainable and inclusive development, besides other co-benefits, such as energy security. Based on these findings, several policy recommendations are proposed to improve the sustainability and inclusivity of urban mobility in Indian cities.",1

8123,16637,On 11th July 2016 the Court of Final Appeal handed down its judgment in two much anticipated decisions concerning money laundering. The ruling resolves issues which have taxed Hong Kong courts for some time and will have a significant impact on the way money laundering cases are prosecuted and defended. Morley Chow Seto outlines here the key findings for criminal practitioners.,1
8124,16638,"Carson Yeung was convicted in the District Court on five charges of money laundering, contrary to section 25(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (“OSCO”). The 4 main issues on his appeal were:",3
8125,16639,"On the basis of the language and structure of the Ordinance, an examination of the amendments made to the provisions creating the offence, the existence of a defence involving disclosure of suspicious transactions and a comparison with money laundering offences in other jurisdictions, the Court held that it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove, as an element of OSCO section 25(1), that the property dealt with by the defendant in fact represents the proceeds of an indictable offence. It is only necessary for the prosecution to prove that the accused dealt with certain property in circumstances where he or she knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that such property represented the proceeds of an indictable offence.",1
8126,16640,"The Court provided clarification as to what constitutes “having reasonable grounds to believe” that property being dealt with represents any person’s proceeds of an indictable offence as prescribed by OSCO section 25(1). It explained its earlier decision in HKSAR v Pang Hung Fai (2014) and endorsed the approach to the “reasonable grounds to believe” mental element adopted by the Appeal Committee in 1999, holding that: “To convict, the jury had to find that the accused had grounds for believing; and there was the additional requirement that the grounds must be reasonable: That is, that anyone looking at those grounds objectively would so believe.”",3
8127,16641,"Whether, and if so how, the rule against duplicity applies in the context of a money laundering charge. In this regard, the second case concerned Mr. Salim Majed who was convicted in the District Court on four charges of money laundering contravening OSCO section 25(1). His conviction was quashed in the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal declined to order a re-trial, holding that the charges were incurably duplicitous. The prosecution obtained leave to appeal on the duplicity issue identical to the one in Yeung’s case.",3
8128,16642,"In Hong Kong, under the Indictment Rules 1976, each paragraph (called a “count”) in an indictment can only properly allege a single offence. This is commonly referred to as the rule against duplicity. The question of duplicity arises where the conduct alleged in a charge involves a number of acts each of which is capable of being treated as a separate offence. In both cases, each of the counts charged money laundering on the basis of numerous deposits into a bank account. The Court held that the purpose of concealing the property comprising those deposits, known or reasonably believed to represent the proceeds of crime, provided a connection which made the individual deposits acts of a similar nature so that they could fairly be regarded as forming part of the same transaction or criminal enterprise. A charge unifying those deposits was therefore justified and the rule against duplicity was not infringed. In Yeung’s case, the CFA upheld the Court of Appeal’s finding that no prejudice was caused by grouping the 963 individual deposits into five charges.",1
8129,16643,"In Majid’s case his defence was that each account was established for the purpose of a legitimate business which he was intending to conduct with Mainland China. This was found to be implausible and was comprehensively rejected by the trial judge. There was no reason to think that his defence would have been any different, or more convincing, had he been charged with 46 offences, or with some different combination of offences, or that in any other respect the aggregation of charges caused any unfairness. The defence case at trial was unaffected by the number of individual acts of dealing which the prosecution alleged.",3
8130,16644,"1. The Court of Final Appeal declined to follow the law in England & Wales and confirmed the existing law in Hong Kong that the prosecution does not have to prove that the property being dealt with was, in fact, the proceeds of crime; to secure a conviction it is enough for the prosecution to establish that the defendant had reasonable grounds to believe that it was.",1
8131,16645,2. The prosecution does not have to charge a separate count for every act of dealing if all the acts can fairly be regarded as being part of the same criminal enterprise. A single charge can cover all the deposits laundered through a single bank account. There is no need for the prosecution to aver a single charge for each individual deposit.,1
8132,16646,"3. On the issue of whether a defendant had the relevant “reasonable grounds to believe” it depends on the state of the evidence. If a Defendant provides no evidence at all of his beliefs and perceptions the Court is left to draw whatever inferences may be proper based on the prosecution evidence. Such evidence will no doubt be intended by the prosecution to be inculpatory as establishing the indicia of money laundering. But such evidence may also be exculpatory, casting doubt on whether the defendant had the necessary reasonable grounds to believe.",1

What keeps this from being a **** 80's Hong Kong action movie is that Hwang Jang Lee's character has little to do with the rest of the characters, as Hwang's scenes are almost cameo scenes, and that the 80's spit microphone punch and kick sound effects aren't used, as the softer Taiwanese sound effects are used, taking the impact away from what could have been a perfect Hong Kong 80's action movie, and Chan Wai Man's cameo is short and disappointing as a bumbling thief who has an unrelated comedic sub plot to the rest of the movie, as Chan doesn't get to fight Hwang. However, Hwang makes this a decent 80's Hong kong action movie when he returns 3/4 into the movie to team up with his sister and the rest of the bumbling characters to tak eon Wang yue and his gang. The final fight is pure Hong Kong kickboxing and brawling at it's best, without the proper sound effects. This movie was directed by famous Shaw character villain, Wang Lung Wei, which Wang is reunited with Hwang Jang Lee and Wang lung Wei from Kid from Kwangtung(1982). Hwang Jang lee was in his prime until the late 90, when he went back to Korea to officially retire and do a few movies there. Innocent interloper is a movie made late in Hwang Jang Lee, and he gets better, powerful, and faster with age. Just take a look and this movie and see.",1

8203,14775,"Gold nanocages with localized surface plasmon resonance peaks in the near-infrared region exhibited a broad two-photon photoluminescence band extending from 450 to 650 nm when excited by a Ti:sapphire laser at 800 nm. The bright luminescence makes it possible to explore the use of Au nanocages as a new class of optical imaging agents for two-photon microscopy. In this work, we have demonstrated the use of two-photon microscopy as a convenient tool to directly examine the uptake of antibody-conjugated and PEGylated Au nanocages by U87MGwtEGFR cells. We have also correlated the results from two-photon microscopy with the data obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Combined together, these results indicate that the antibody-conjugated Au nanocages were attached to the surface of the cells through antibody−antigen binding and then internalized into the cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis.

8230,14802,Justice A M Magray who adjudicated their case (filed in 2017) observed that the petitioners have miserably failed in establishing their claims of having worked any time during or after the 2011 in the department.,1
8231,14803,"Before parting with the case, the judge expressed his wish to observe that “at times the authorities tend to be revengeful against those who approach courts claiming reliefs against them, because they feel like having been put to face awkward situations while defending such claims, as in the instant case”.",1
8232,14804,"Consequently, they do not engage such persons in future, said the judge adding “I make it clear that filing of this case before the court should not be an excuse for the respondents not to engage the petitioners or anyone of them on need-basis in the future”.",1
8233,14805,They sought regularization of their services in view of the law laid down by High Court in case titled State of J&K versus Mushtaq Ahmad Sohail (2012) by treating them to have been engaged as daily-rated workers.,1

Besides they solicited the government not to disturb their present status and allow them to continue on the posts held by them till their regularization.,1
8235,14807,The court after examining the documents submitted in the petition observed that the petitioners have failed to even remotely establish that they have worked any time during or after the year 2011 in PHE department.,1

None of the Muster Rolls pertains to any month of the year 2011 or a month of any of the years thereafter. Similarly, none of the formats referred to have disclosed payments having been paid for any of the months of the year 2010 or thereafter,” it said.",1

This argument was stated to be based on s. 25(4) of OSCO but (not surprisingly) was emphatically rejected by the Court of Final Appeal.",3
8240,14812,"The appellant had been convicted in the lower courts of dealing with property having a reasonable belief that it represented the proceeds of an indictable offence. The appellant appears to have operated an “underground banking operation”, whereby monies were received from places in Asia and Africa, deposited into bank accounts in Hong Kong (controlled through him) and remitted to places such as Mainland China. The purpose of these arrangements may have been to circumvent certain exchange control restrictions.",1

8242,14814,"In light of the CFA’s judgment in HKSAR v Yeung Ka Sing Carson, the appellant’s challenge appears to have changed tack and the focus of the appeal became s.25(4) of OSCO. In short, the appellant was seeking to argue that with respect to “overseas conduct” it was necessary for the prosecution to prove (as part of the mens rea) that he was aware of the nature of the activity that produced the property with which he dealt.",1
8243,14815,"The judgment in HKSAR v Yang Sigai confirms that where the property in question is derived from an identifiable act committed overseas it is caught by s.25(1) of OSCO if such conduct constitutes an indictable offence in Hong Kong, regardless of the legal position in the jurisdiction where the conduct took pace. As the Chief Justice states, in giving the unanimous judgment of the CFA (at para. 15):",1
8244,14816,"The judgment in HKSAR v Yang Sigai is underpinned by strong policy reasons. The purpose of s. 25 of OSCO is to deter individuals from using Hong Kong to launder the proceeds of crime, irrespective of where the conduct occurs. The question is not whether the conduct is an offence in the foreign country where it took place, but rather whether the overseas conduct amounts to an indictable offence if it was committed in Hong Kong.",1

8289,14861,"Dowry has been one of the leading causes of torture of women in Bangladesh. (2) The Dowry Prohibition Act 1980 (the Act) outlaws dowry with a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment, and safeguard from physical abuses is repeatedly affirmed in several pieces of legislation (Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh 1972, art 35(5); Penal Code 1860 ss 324-331). Women's dignity as core value of human rights law is deeply entrenched in numerous international instruments under which Bangladesh also assumes affirmative obligations to respect and ensure this right. (3) Despite this, dowry-related cruelty is endemic. In 2011 alone, dowry-related violence claimed 325 lives and resulted in 7,079 incidents of dowry-harassment (Haq 2012). This represents only a fraction of total dowry-victims since women are very reluctant to unearth their 'hidden wounds' publicly for several reasons, including loss of family honour and privacy, fear of in-law reprisals and poor access to inadequate and costly legal remedies (Begum 2005a, 228-229). Further, in a substantial number of cases, influential perpetrators act with impunity due to corruption and victims are left with virtually no legal recourse (Begum 2009, 178-179). The underlying cause of this rising trend of violence, notwithstanding the existence of a series of positive statutes, necessitates an exploration of factors affecting the origins and development of dowry and how it is addressed in Bangladesh.",3
8290,14862,"I argue that law's failure to recognise a number of crucial aspects of dowry--including a range of serious flaws in the Act and the 'softness' of the current enforcement procedure--significantly contributes to the nourishment of dowry. This article explores dowry through an analysis of the Act with special reference to a number of legal provisions in India and the USA and recommends the reconceptualisation of laws to redress women's sufferings in abusive marital relationships. Before advancing with this discussion, it is, however, important to acknowledge that despite legislative changes and progressive attempts by the judiciary, dowry or other spousal abuses still persist in those jurisdictions. Nevertheless, it is evident that awareness of dowry/domestic abuses and for the need for legal sanctions to combat it has been raised higher than ever before and the law does have a significant contribution to achieve this end. Additionally, strengthening legal regime may not be a panacea for redressing dowry in Bangladesh, and some socio-economic factors may remain dominant perpetuating dowry. Yet, this should neither outweigh the necessity for legal changes nor is it practicable to address all socio-economic aspects of dowry in a single study.",1

It is only necessary for the prosecution to prove that the accused dealt with certain property in circumstances where he or she knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that such property represented the proceeds of an indictable offence.",3

In this regard, the second case concerned Mr. Salim Majed who was convicted in the District Court on four charges of money laundering contravening OSCO section 25(1). His conviction was quashed in the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal declined to order a re-trial, holding that the charges were incurably duplicitous. The prosecution obtained leave to appeal on the duplicity issue identical to the one in Yeung’s case.",3
8438,18001,"In Hong Kong, under the Indictment Rules 1976, each paragraph (called a “count”) in an indictment can only properly allege a single offence. This is commonly referred to as the rule against duplicity. The question of duplicity arises where the conduct alleged in a charge involves a number of acts each of which is capable of being treated as a separate offence. In both cases, each of the counts charged money laundering on the basis of numerous deposits into a bank account. The Court held that the purpose of concealing the property comprising those deposits, known or reasonably believed to represent the proceeds of crime, provided a connection which made the individual deposits acts of a similar nature so that they could fairly be regarded as forming part of the same transaction or criminal enterprise. A charge unifying those deposits was therefore justified and the rule against duplicity was not infringed. In Yeung’s case, the CFA upheld the Court of Appeal’s finding that no prejudice was caused by grouping the 963 individual deposits into five charges.",3
8439,18002,"In Majid’s case his defence was that each account was established for the purpose of a legitimate business which he was intending to conduct with Mainland China. This was found to be implausible and was comprehensively rejected by the trial judge. There was no reason to think that his defence would have been any different, or more convincing, had he been charged with 46 offences, or with some different combination of offences, or that in any other respect the aggregation of charges caused any unfairness. The defence case at trial was unaffected by the number of individual acts of dealing which the prosecution alleged.",3
8440,18003,"1. The Court of Final Appeal declined to follow the law in England & Wales and confirmed the existing law in Hong Kong that the prosecution does not have to prove that the property being dealt with was, in fact, the proceeds of crime; to secure a conviction it is enough for the prosecution to establish that the defendant had reasonable grounds to believe that it was.",1
8441,18004,2. The prosecution does not have to charge a separate count for every act of dealing if all the acts can fairly be regarded as being part of the same criminal enterprise. A single charge can cover all the deposits laundered through a single bank account. There is no need for the prosecution to aver a single charge for each individual deposit.,1
8442,18005,"3. On the issue of whether a defendant had the relevant “reasonable grounds to believe” it depends on the state of the evidence. If a Defendant provides no evidence at all of his beliefs and perceptions the Court is left to draw whatever inferences may be proper based on the prosecution evidence. Such evidence will no doubt be intended by the prosecution to be inculpatory as establishing the indicia of money laundering. But such evidence may also be exculpatory, casting doubt on whether the defendant had the necessary reasonable grounds to believe.",1

About 55% of rural households and 93% of urban households had access to electricity. The 2005 Indian Human Development Survey showed that on average, electricity availability (hours of supply per day) in rural and urban households were 14 and 19 h, respectively (Desai et al., 2007). Using nationally representative data from Indian Human Development Survey, this study estimated the impact of electricity access and availability on two attributes of human well-being, viz. education and health attainment. It found a significant positive relationship between electricity availability and well-being in rural and urban households. Electricity accessibility, revealed a significant positive relationship only for rural households. The paper concludes with implications for electricity policy and infrastructure choices. - Graphical abstract: Impact of electricity security on the attributes of human well-being. - Highlights: • Nexus between well-being, and electricity access and availability is quantified. • Electricity access is positively associated with well-being in rural but not urban. • Electricity availability negatively associates with morbidity and absenteeism. • Electricity security as human well-being enabler seeks nuanced policy attention. • Decentralized rapidly deployable modular technologies and microgrids are advocated",1

8666,16530,"Antioxidant activities of methanol extracts of 180 Oriental herbs were studied by determining the peroxide values of linoleic acid during storage at 50°C. Among the herb extracts tested, 44 species showed strong antioxidant activities on the oxidation of linoleic acid. The antioxidative effects of these 44 selected herb extracts were studied further in a methyl linoleate system during storage for 35 d. Among the 44 species tested, 11 species had particularly high antioxidative effects. The effects of type of extraction solvent (methanol, petroleum ether and ethyl acetate) on the antioxidant activities of the 11 species were studied. Antioxidant activities of most herb extracts were greatly dependent on the extraction solvent used; however, some of the extracts showed strong antioxidant activities regardless of the solvents used for the extraction. Among the 11 herbs selected, based on the antioxidant activity of their methanol extracts, two (i.e.,Psoralea corylifolia L. andSorphora angustifolia Sieb. & Zucc.) were selected for further study in lard held at 75°C for 7 d. The methanol extracts ofP. corylifolia L. andS. angustifolia Sieb. & Zucc. greatly decreased the peroxide formation of lard during storage.

8671,16573,This prospective study was carried on 250 patients to study the complication and recurrence rate associated with Lichtenstien repair of inguinal hernia in our clinical and socioeconomic settings. The cost effectiveness and return to work after surgery were the other outcome measures. Two hundred and fifty patients underwent mesh repair of inguinal hernia at two different centers over a period of two years. All the patients were operated under local anesthesia. A bolus dose of preoperative antibiotic was given intravenously. The patients were followed up for two years and their post operative course was assessed according to a prescribed proforma. The rate of minor complications was in the range of 11.8%. The recurrence rate was 1.2%.There was minimal pain and the procedure was cost effective in terms of operative cost and less economic loss due to early return to work. It is concluded that Lichtenstien repair as a day case is safe and effective procedure to be performed by a trained general surgeon under local anesthesia. The infection rate and the recurrence rate are low. The compliance and acceptability of the patient and ease of carrying out the procedure under local anesthesia by surgeon is acceptable. In our view this type of hernial repair is an appropriate method in district hospital and tehsial headquarter hospitals where provision of anaesthesia facilities are yet to be fully developed and hospitals cater a major hernial load due to elderly patients with background of farming professions being admitted. The patient can be sent home on same day after surgery.,1

We reported on this in November 2014. In April 2015 we reported on the case of Salim Majid where the question of duplicity in money-laundering charges is to be considered by the Court of Final Appeal. The question of duplicity in money laundering charges has again arisen in the appeal of the former Birmingham City Football Football Club President, Carson Yeung Ka Sing. The Prosecution has been granted leave to appeal on the following questions:",3

In particular, whether the offence of money laundering, capable of being committed in any of the modes of ‘dealing’ as included in its definition under section 2 of the Ordinance, is or could be a continuing offence so that the rule against duplicity does not apply; and how do the exceptions to the rule against duplicity (namely, ‘one transaction’ as in DPP v Merriman [1973] AC 584, ‘general deficiency’ as in R v Tomlin [1954] 2 QB 274 and ‘continuous course of conduct’ as in Barton v DPP [2001] 165 JP 779) apply to a charge of money laundering which alleges multiple dealings some of which involve money from known and different sources?”",1

Under what circumstances should the trial judge apply these two formulations?”",1
8732,16792,"(1) “On a charge of dealing with proceeds of crime contrary to s.25 (1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) (“OSCO”), is it necessary for the prosecution to prove, as an element of the offence, that the proceeds being dealt with were in fact proceeds of an indictable offence? Was Oei Hengky Wiryo (2007) 10 HKCFAR 98 wrongly decided on this issue?”",1

The established actors are good in their respective roles and even the cheesy moments are integral to the enjoyment of the film. And, as usual, the stunts are `cringeworthy' but fantastic.The only gripe was my copy arrived in bad condition where the centre retaining piece had been broken in transit. This left the disc to move around within the case and cause severe scratches making certain scenes freeze.

Big mistake if you ask me - but hey, why don't you make up your own mind and try the original? It just might be your thing.
